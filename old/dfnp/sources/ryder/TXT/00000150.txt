THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            143
Then the jackal and the crow, who lived on others*
luck, went hungry, and they implored the lion.
"Master," they said, "where do you go every day?
And tell us why you come back so happy." "I don't
go anywhere," said he. But when they urged the
question with great deference, the lion said: "A friend
of mine comes into this wood every day. His wife
cooks the most delicious things, and I eat them every
day, in order to show friendly feeling."
Then the jackal and the crow said: "We two will
go there, will kill the carpenter, and have enough
meat and blood to keep us fat for a long time." But
the lion heard them and said: "Look here! I guar-
anteed his safety. How can I even imagine playing
him such a scurvy trick? But I will get a delicious
tidbit from him for you also." To this they agreed.
So the three started to find the carpenter. While
they were still far off, the carpenter caught a glimpse
of the lion and his seedy companions, and he thought:
"This does not look prosperous to me." So he and
his wife made haste to climb a tree.
Then the lion came up and said: "My good fel-
low, why did you climb a tree when you saw me?
Why, I am your friend, the lion. My name is Spot-
less. Do not be alarmed." But the carpenter stayed
where he was and said:
Your jackal does not reassure;
Your crow's sharp bill offends:
You therefore see me up a tree—
I do not like your friends.
