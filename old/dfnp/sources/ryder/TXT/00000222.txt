THE WINNING OF FRIENDS        215
How did Rama fail to see
Golden deer could never be?
How Yudhishthir fail to know
Gambling brings a train of woe?
Clutching evil dims the sense,
Darkening intelligence.
And again:
When once the mind is gripped by fate,
The judgment even of the great,
In mortal meshes fettered, wends
To unintended, crooked ends.
So the hunter gleefully lifted his club and ran
forward. Then Gay-Neck and his retainers, seeing
him advancing, were distressed by their disastrous
position in the snare. But the king, with much pre-
sence of mind, said to the doves: "Have no fear, my
friends. For
Provided judgment does not fail,
Whatever the distress,
Men reach the farther shore of woe,
And rest in happiness.
We must all agree in purpose, must fly up in uni-
son, and carry the snare away. This is not possible
without united action. For death befalls those of dis-
united purpose. As the saying goes:
Bharunda birds will teach you why
The disunited surely die:
For, single-bellied, double-necked,
They took a diet incorrect/'
