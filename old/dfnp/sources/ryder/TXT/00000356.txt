there is—a remedy depending on you alone/ Of
course I said: 'If it cost my life, pray tell me, and I
will do it/ Then the goddess said: 'If you go to bed
with another man, and embrace him, then the un-
timely death that threatens your husband will pass
to him. And your husband will live another hundred
years/ For this purpose I invited you. Now do what
you had in mind. The words of a goddess must not
be falsified—so much is certain/' Then his face
blossomed with noiseless laughter, and he did as she
said.
Now the carpenter, fool that he was, felt his body
thrill with joy on hearing her words, and he issued
from under the bed, saying: "Bravo, faithful wife!
Bravo, delight of the family! Because my heart was
troubled by the gossip of evil creatures, I pretended
a trip to another village in order to test you, and
lay hidden under the bed. Come now, embrace
me!"
With these words he embraced her and lifted her
to his shoulder, then said to the fellow: "My dear
and honored sir, you have come here because my
good deeds earned this happiness. Through your
favor I have won a full hundred years of life. You,
too, must mount my shoulder/'
So he forced the fellow, much against his will, to
mount his shoulder, and then went dancing about
to the doors of the houses of all his relatives.
