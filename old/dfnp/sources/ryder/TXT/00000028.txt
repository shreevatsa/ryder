BOOK I
THE LOSS OF FRIENDS
Here then begins Book I, called "The Loss of
Friends." The first verse runs:
The forest lion and the bull
Were linked in friendship, growing, full:
A jackal then estranged the friends
For greedy and malicious ends.
And this is how it happened.
In the southern country was a city called Maidens'
Delight. It rivaled the city of heaven's King, so
abounding in every urban excellence as to form the
central jewel of Earth's diadem. Its contour was like
that of Kailasa Peak. Its gates and palaces were
stocked with machines, missile weapons, and chariots
in great variety. Its central portal, massive as Indra-
kila Mountain, was fitted with bolt and bar, panel
and arch, all formidable, impressive, solid. Its numer-
ous temples lifted their firm bulk near spacious
squares and crossings. It wore a moat-girdled zone
of walls that recalled the high-uplifted Himalayas.
In this city lived a merchant named Increase. He
possessed a heap of numerous virtues, and a heap of
money, a result of the accumulation of merit in
earlier lives.
