THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            209
The wise discover in wise books
What course is wise and right,
And wise books in the course that is
Not violent, delight.
"Therefore a counselor should under no circum-
stances advise his master to fight. And there is
another wise saying:
Where the palace harbors servants
Kindly, modest, pure,
Death to enemies, and deaf to
Avarice's lure,
Foes may struggle, but the royal
Honor is secure.
Therefore
Speak the truth, though harsh it be:
Blarney is true enmity.
And again:
Where royal servants, asked or not,
Indulge in pleasant lies
That lead the royal mind astray,
The royal glory dies.
"Furthermore, counselors should be consulted
severally by the master, who should thereupon make
his own decision concerning the advice given by each,
as tending to the king's loss or profit. For it happens
at times that even an established fact seems other-
wise to a wandering judgment. As the proverb says:
The firefly seems a fire, the sky looks flat;
Yet sky and fly are neither this nor that.
