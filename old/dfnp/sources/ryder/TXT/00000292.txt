THE WINNING OF FRIENDS        287
twinkling set Slow free to seek refuge in the water
near by, his natural fortress. I myself will slide into
a grass-clump. You, furthermore, must plan a second
escape when the beast of a hunter is upon you." So
they put this plan into practice.
Now when the hunter saw a deer as good as dead
beside the water, and noticed that a crow was peck-
ing at him, he joyfully threw the turtle on the ground,
and ran for a club. As soon as Spot could tell from
the tramp of feet that the hunter was close upon him,
with a supreme burst of speed he swept into dense
forest. Swift flew into a tree. The turtle, his fetter-
ing cord cut by Gold, scrambled to shelter in the
water. Gold slipped into a grass-clump.
To the hunter it seemed a conjurer's trick.
"What does it mean?" he cried in his disappointment.
Then he returned to the spot where he had left the
turtle, and saw the cord cut in a hundred pieces no
longer than a finger's breadth. Then he perceived
that the turtle had vanished like a magician, and
anticipated danger for his own person. With troubled
heart he made all speed out of the wood for home,
casting anxious glances at the horizon.
Meanwhile the four friends, free of all injury, came
together, expressed their mutual affection, took a new
lease on life, and lived happily. And so
If beasts enjoy so great a prize
Of friendship, why should wonder rise
In men, who are so very wise?
