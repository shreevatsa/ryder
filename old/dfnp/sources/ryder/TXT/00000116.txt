THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            107
Even now, this Lively manages all business as he
will, without restraint of any kind. Hence the well-
known saying finds application:
A counselor who tramples through
His business, though his heart be true,
May not unheeded go his way,
Since future days the present pay.
But such is the nature of kings. As the poet sings:
Some gentle actions born of love
To thoughts of active hatred move;
Some deeds of traitorous offense
Win guerdon of benevolence;
The kingly mind can no man tame,
As never being twice the same:
Such service makes the spirit faint,
A hard conundrum for a saint."
On hearing this, Rusty said: "After all, he is my
servant. Why should he experience a change of heart
toward me?" But Victor answered: "Servant or not,
there is nothing conclusive in that. For the proverb
says:
The man who loves not royalty,
Just serving while he can
Find nothing better worth his pains,
Is not a loyal man."
"My dear fellow," said the lion, "even so, I can-
not find it in my heart to turn against him. For
However false and fickle grown,
Once dear is always dear:
Who does not love his body, though
Decrepit, blemished, queer?
