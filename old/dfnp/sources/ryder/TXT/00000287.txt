282             THE PANCHATANTRA
"Thus, though having suffered a previous cap-
tivity, I am caught again through constraining des-
tiny."
At this moment Slow joined them. For his heart
was so full of love for his friend that he had followed,
leaving grass, shrubs, and spear-grass crushed behind
him. At sight of him, they were more distressed than
ever, and Gold became their spokesman. "My dear
fellow," said he, "you have done wrong in leaving
your fortress to come here, since you are not able to
save yourself from the hunter, while on us he cannot
lay hands. For when the bonds are cut and the hunter
stands near, Spot will bound away and disappear,
Swift will fly into a tree, while I, being a little fellow,
will find some chink to slide into. But what will you
do, when within his reach?"
To this Slow listened, but he said: "Oh, do not
blame me, you of all people. For
The loss of love and loss of wealth
Who could endure
But for restoratives of health
In friendship sure?
And again:
The days when meetings do not fail
With wise and good
Are lovely clearings on the trail
Through life's wild wood.
The heart finds rest in telling things
(When troubles toss)
