my friend. Yet so it goes with the unfortunate. You

Are lost. But why this vacant stare?"
"How was that?" asked the monkey. And the

THE FARMER'S WIFE
There was once a farmer who lived with his wife
in a certain place. And because the husband was
old, the wife was forever thinking of lovers, and
could not possibly be contented at home. Her one
idea was strange men.
Now a rogue who lived by pilfering, noticed her
and said: "You lovely creature, my wife is dead, and
I am smitten with love at the sight of you. Pray en-
rich me with love's perfect treasure."
And she said: "You beautiful man, if you feel
that way, my husband has a great deal of money,
and he is so old that he cannot stir. I will bring it, so
that I may go somewhere with you and enjoy the
delights of love."
"That is satisfactory to me," he replied. "Sup-
pose you hasten to this spot at dawn, so that we may
go together to some fascinating city where life may
bear for me its perfect fruit." "Very well/' she
agreed, and went home with laughing countenance.
