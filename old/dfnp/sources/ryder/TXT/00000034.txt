crouch here so disconsolate ?" "Why meddle, my dear
fellow?" said Cheek. "There is a saying:
Death pursues the meddling flunkey:
Note the wedge-extracting monkey."
"How was that?" asked Victor. And Cheek told
the story of
THE WEDGE-PULLING MONKEY
There was a city in a certain region. In a grove
near by, a merchant was having a temple built. Each
day at the noon hour the foreman and workers would
go to the city for lunch.
Now one day a troop of monkeys came upon the
half-built temple. There lay a tremendous anj ana-
log, which a mechanic had begun to split, a wedge of
acacia-wood being thrust in at the top.
There the monkeys began their playful frolics
upon tree-top, lofty roof, and woodpile. Then one of
them, whose doom was near, thoughtlessly bestrode
the log, thinking: "Who stuck a wedge in this queer
place?" So he seized it with both hands and started
to work it loose. Now what happened when the wedge
gave at the spot where his private parts entered the
cleft, that, sir, you know without being told.
"And that is why I say that meddling should be
avoided by the intelligent. And you know," he con-
tinued, "that we two pick up a fair living just from
his leavings."
