saying: "I trust your circumstances are happy. Pray
tell us how you happened into this neck of the
woods." And Spot replied: "I am weary of a life
without love. I have been hard pressed on every side
by mounted grooms and dogs and hunters. But fear
lent speed, I left them all behind, and came here to
drink. Now I am desirous of your friendship."
Upon hearing this, Slow said: "We are little of
body. It is unnatural for you to make friends with us.
One should make friends with those capable of re-
turning favors." But Spot rejoined:
"Better with the learned dwell,
Even though it be in hell
Than with vulgar spirits roam
Palaces that gods call home.
"And since you know that one little of body may
be of no little consequence, why these self-deprecia-
tory remarks? Yet after all, such speech is becoming
to the excellent. I therefore insist that you make
friends with me today. There is a good old saying:
Make friends, make friends, however strong
Or weak they be:
Recall the captive elephants
That mice set free."
