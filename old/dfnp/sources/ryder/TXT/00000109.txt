ioo             THE PANCHATANTRA
Then he summoned Lovely and with respectful
coaxing said: "Dear child, relying on your husband's
power, we have begun hostilities with the enemy.
This very night pray speak to blessed Vishnu when he
comes, so that in the morning he may kill this enemy
of ours."
So Lovely delivered to him at night her father's
message, complete in every particular. On hearing it,
the weaver laughed and said: "Dear love, how little a
business is this, a mere war with men! Why, in days
gone by I have with the greatest ease slain mighty
demons by the thousand, and they were armed with
magic; there was Hiranyakashipu, and Kansa, and
Madhu, and Kaitabha, to name but a few. Go, then,
and say to the king: 'Dismiss anxiety. In the morn-
ing Vishnu will slay the host of your enemies with his
discus.'"
So she went to the king and proudly told him all.
Whereat he was overjoyed and commanded the door-
keeper to have proclamation made with beat of drum
throughout the city, in these words: "Whatever any
shall lay hands on during tomorrow's battle in the
camp of Valor slain, whether coined money or grain
or gold or elephant or horse or weapon or other object,
that shall remain his personal possession." This proc-
lamation delighted the citizens, so that they gossiped
together, saying: "This king of ours is a lofty soul,
unalarmed even in the presence of the hostile host.
He is certain to kill his rival in the morning."
