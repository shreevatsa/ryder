"How was that?" asked the crocodile. And the
monkey told the story of
THE POTTER MILITANT
There was once a potter in a certain place. One
day he carelessly ran with all his might into the
jagged edge of a broken pot, and tumbled. And
though the jagged edge tore his forehead, he strug-
gled to his feet, blood streaming over his body. Now
as the wound was unskilfully treated, the scar cica-
trized horribly.
After some time the land was afflicted with famine,
and he felt the pinch of hunger. So he joined certain
life-guards, went to another country, and became a
life-guard.
Now the king noticed on his brow the horrible
scar from the potsherd, and he thought: "Surely,
this man is a great hero. He took a wound in front,
on his brow." So he bestowed honors and gifts and
the like, regarding him more graciously than all
others. Even the princes, observing the exceptional
favor shown him, cherished an extreme jealousy, yet
they feared the king and said not a word.
Now one day there was a review of picked troops.
While the elephants were being accoutered and the
horses caparisoned and the men inspected, the king
took occasion to say to the potter: "O Prince, what is
your name? And what your family? In what battle
was this wound printed on your brow?"
