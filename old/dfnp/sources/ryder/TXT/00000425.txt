4io             THE PANCHATANTRA
As the laundryman wandered in the forest, he
saw a dead tiger, and he thought: "Ah, this is lucky.
I will put this tiger-skin on the donkey and let him
loose in the barley fields at night. For the farmers
will think him a tiger and will not drive him out."
When this was done, the donkey ate barley to his
heart's content. And at dawn the laundryman took
him back to the barn. So as time passed, he grew
plump. He could hardly squeeze into the stall.
But one day the donkey heard the bray of a she-
donkey in the distance. At the mere sound he himself
began to bray. Then the farmers perceived that he
was a donkey in disguise, and killed him with blows
from clubs and stones and arrows.
"And that is why I say:
However skilful in disguise, ....
and the rest of it."
Now while the monkey was telling these stories
to the crocodile, another water-beast came up and
said: "Friend crocodile, your wife has starved herself
to death."
When the crocodile heard this, he was bewildered
in spirit, and lamented: "Oh, what has come upon
me, upon hapless me? For the proverb says:
Where a mother does not dwell
And a wife who flatters well,
Better leave the house, and roam
Forests not so wild as home.
