But one day the Brahman's wife was watching the
marriage festival of a neighbor's son, and the tears
streamed down her face as she said to her husband:
"I know that you despise me, because you do nothing
about a marriage festival for my boy." "My good
wife," answered he, "am I to go to the depths of the
underworld and beseech Vasuki the serpent-king?
Who else, you foolish woman, would give his own
daughter to this snake?"
But when he had spoken, he was disturbed at see-
ing the utter woe in his wife's countenance. He there-
fore packed provisions for a long journey, and under-
took foreign travel from love of his wife. In the course
of some months he arrived at a spot called Kutkuta
City in a distant land. There in the house of a kins-
man whom he could visit with pleasure since each re-
spected the other's character, he was hospitably re-
ceived, was given a bath, food, and the like, and there
he spent the night.
Now at dawn, when he paid his respects to his
Brahman host and made ready to depart, the other
asked him: "What was your purpose in coming
hither? And where will your errand lead you?"
To this he replied: "I have come in search of a
fit wife for my son." "In that case," said his host, "I
have a very beautiful daughter, and my own person
is yours to command. Pray take her for your son."
