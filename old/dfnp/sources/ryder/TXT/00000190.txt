THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            183
THE UNTEACHABLE MONKEY
In a part of a forest was a troop of monkeys who
found a firefly one winter evening when they were
dreadfully depressed. On examining the insect, they
believed it to be fire, so lifted it with care, covered it
with dry grass and leaves, thrust forward their arms,
sides, stomachs, and chests, scratched themselves,
and enjoyed imagining that they were warm. One of
the arboreal creatures in particular, being especially
chilly, blew repeatedly and with concentrated atten-
tion on the firefly.
Thereupon a bird named Needle-Face, driven by
hostile fate to her own destruction, flew down from
her tree and said to the monkey: "My dear sir, do
not put yourself to unnecessary trouble. This is not
fire. This is a firefly." He, however, did not heed her
warning but blew again, nor did he stop when she
tried more than once to check him. To cut a long
story short, when she vexed him by coming close and
shouting in his ear, he seized her and dashed her on a
rock, crushing face, eyes, head, and neck so that she
died.
"And that is why I say:
No knife prevails against a stone; ....
and the rest of it. For, after all,
Educating minds unfit
Cannot rescue sluggish wit,
Just as house-lamps wasted are,
Set within a covered jar.
