Then the southern monarch, with his troops and
retainers, at the head of an army with all four service
branches, marched against the king. And he angrily
cried:
This king may climb the heavenly mount,
May plunge beneath the sea;
And yet—I promise it—the wretch
Shall soon be slain by me.
So Valor reached the country by marches never
interrupted, and ravaged it. And the inhabitants who
survived the slaughter besieged the palace gate of the
king of Sugarcane City, and taunted him. But what
he heard did not cause %the king the slightest anxiety.
On the following day the forces of King Valor ar-
rived and invested Sugarcane City, whereupon hosts
of counselors and chaplains interceded with the king:
"O King," they said, "a powerful enemy has arrived
and invested the city. How can the king show him-
self so unconcerned?'" And the king replied: "You
gentlemen may be quite comfortable. I have devised
a means of killing this foe. What I am about to do to
his army, you, too, will learn tomorrow morning."
After this address, he bade them provide adequate
defense for the walls and gates.
