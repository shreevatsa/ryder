86               THE PANCHATANTRA
After listening to this, Numskull said: "Well,
well, my good fellow, show me that sneak thief of a
lion, and be quick about it. I cannot find peace of
mind until I have vented on him my anger against the
animals. He should have remembered the saying:
Land and friends and gold at most
Have been won when battles cease;
If but one of these should fail,
Do not think of breaking peace.
Where no great reward is won,
Where defeat is nearly sure,
Never stir a quarrel, but
Find it wiser to endure."
"Quite so, master," said the rabbit. "Warriors
fight for their country when they are insulted. But
this fellow skulks in a fortress. You know he came
out of a fortress when he held us up. And an enemy
in a fortress is hard to handle. As the saying goes:
A single royal fortress adds
More military force
Than do a thousand elephants,
A hundred thousand horse.
A single archer from a wall
A hundred foes forfends;
And so the military art
A fortress recommends.
God Indra used the wit and skill
Of gods in days of old,
When Devil Gold-mat plagued the world,
To build a fortress-hold.
