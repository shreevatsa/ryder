and palace-roofs with a pearl necklace embellishing
his throat, and they asked him: "Well, chief, where
have you spent this long time? Where did you get a
pearl necklace like that? Its dazzling beauty dims the
very sun."
And the monkey answered: "In a spot in the
forest is a shrewdly hidden lake, a creation of the god
of wealth. Through his grace, if anyone bathes there
at sunrise on Sunday, he comes out with a pearl
necklace like this embellishing his throat."
Now the king heard this from somebody, sum-
moned the monkey, and asked: "Is this true, chief?"
"O King," said the monkey, "you have visible proof
in the pearl necklace on my throat. If you, too, could
find a use for one, send somebody with me, and I will
show him."
On hearing this, the king said: "In view of the
facts, I will come myself with my retinue, so that we
may acquire numbers of pearl necklaces." "O King,"
said the monkey, "your idea is delicious."
So the king and his retinue started, greedy for
pearl necklaces. And the king in his palanquin
clasped the monkey to his bosom, showing him
honor as they traveled. For there is wisdom in the
saying:
The educated and the rich,
Befooled by greed,
Plunge into wickedness, then feel
The pinch of need.
