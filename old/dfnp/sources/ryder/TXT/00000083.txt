74              THE PANCHATANTRA
"Now our master Rusty has fallen into the very
first vice, that of deficiency. For he has been so capti-
vated by Lively that he pays not the smallest heed
to counselor or any other of the six supports of his

morality. So what is the use of a lengthy discussion?
Rusty must by all means be detached from Lively.
No lamp, no light."
"How will you detach him?" objected Cheek.
"You have not the power." "My dear fellow," said
Victor, "there is a verse to fit the situation, namely:
In cases where brute force would fail,
A shrewd device may still prevail:
The crow-hen used a golden chain,
And so the dreadful snake was slain."

HOW THE CROW-HEN KILLED

In a certain region grew a great banyan tree. In
it lived a crow and his wife, occupying the nest which
they had built. But a black snake crawled through
the hollow trunk and ate their chicks as fast as they
were born, even before baptism. Yet for all his sorrow
over this violence, the poor crow could not desert the
old familiar banyan and seek another tree. For
Three cannot be induced to go—
The deer, the cowardly man, the crow:
Three go when insult makes them pant—
The lion, hero, elephant.
