CROWS AND OWLS                 333
"How was that?" asked the men. And the Brah-
man told the story of
THE UNSOCIAL SWANS
There was once a king named Gay-Chariot in a
certain place. He owned a lake named Lotus Lake,
which his soldiers guarded carefully. For many
golden swans lived there, and they gave one tail-
feather apiece every six months.
Now to that lake came a great bird, all of gold.
And they told him: "You cannot live among us.
For we have rented this lake at the rate of a tail-
feather for six months." And so, to cut a long story
short, a dispute arose.
Then the great bird sought the king's protection,
saying: "O King, those birds ask: 'What will our
king do? We give lodging to nobody/ And I said:
'You are not very polite. I will go and tell the king/
This is the situation. The king must decide."
Then the king said to his men: "Go, you. Kill
all the birds and bring them here at once." And they
started immediately, obeying the king's command.
Now one old bird saw the king's men with clubs in
their hands, and he said: "Well, kinsmen, this is
rather unpleasant. We must all hang together. Let
us fly up and away." And they did so.
"And that is why I say:
Be generous to all that lives, . . .
and the rest of it."
