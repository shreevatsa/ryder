delay. Listen to me.
When life is near an end,
The presence of a friend
Brings happiness, allying
The living with the dying.
Oh, pardon any expressions of friendly impatience I
may have used in our discussions. Likewise, say to
Gold and Slow in my name:
If any ugly word
Was willy-nilly heard,
I pray you both, forgive—
Let only friendship live."
On hearing this, Swift replied: "Feel no fear, my
dear fellow, while you have friends like us. I will re-
turn with all speed, bringing Gold to cut your bonds."
Thereupon, with his heart in a flutter, he found
Slow and Gold, explained the nature of Spot's cap-
tivity, then returned to Spot, carrying Gold in his
beak. Gold, for his part, on seeing the plight of his
friend, sorrowfully said: "My dear fellow, you al-
ways had a wary mind and a shrewd eye. How, then,
did you fall into this dreadful captivity?"
And Spot rejoined: "Why ask, my friend? Fate,
you know, does what it will. As the saying goes:
What mortal flies
(However wise)
When billows rise
To fatal size
On seas of woe?
