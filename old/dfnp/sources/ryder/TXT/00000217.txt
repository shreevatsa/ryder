210             THE PANCHATANTRA
And again:
The true seem often false, the false seem true;
Appearances deceive, so think it through.
"Consequently, a master should not implicitly
rely on the advice of a servant who lacks the admin-
istrative sense, inasmuch as rascally servants, for
their personal profit, present matters to the master in
a false light, and with bewildering eloquence. Hence,
a master should undertake a matter only after full
reflection. As the proverb says:
Let fit and friendly counsel first,
And more than once, be heard;
Then ponder on the plan proposed
From first to final word;
Then act, and harvest fame and wealth,
Avoiding the absurd.
"Finally, let no master suffer his mind to be
twitched aside by others' counsel. Let him always be
mindful of the differences in men, let him fully con-
sider the ultimate issue, whether favorable or the
reverse, of various counsels, answers, and times of
action. Let him be the master, a wise master, ever
cognizant of the multiform complexities of duty."
Here ends Book I, called "The Loss of Friends."
The first verse runs:
The forest lion and the bull
Were linked in friendship, growing, full;
A jackal then estranged the friends
For greedy and malicious ends.
