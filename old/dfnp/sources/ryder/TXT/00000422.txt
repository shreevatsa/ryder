this mean ?" she said: "This is my invalid husband
who was tormented by countless relatives, until,
distracted by love, I put him on my head and brought
him before you." And the king said: "You are my
sister. Receive two villages, enjoy their delights
with your husband, and make yourself comfortable."
At this point the Brahman arrived in the same
city, for a certain holy man, as it happened, had
drawn him from the well, and he had wandered on.
When the wicked wife saw him, she denounced him
to the king. "O King," she said, "there comes my
husband's enemy."
And the king sentenced him to death.
But the Brahman said: "Your Majesty, this
woman has something which she received from me.
If you love justice, make her give it back." "My
good woman," said the king, "restore whatever you
may have that belongs to him," And she replied:
"Your Majesty, I have nothing."
Then the Brahman said: "With three magic
words I gave you half my life. Give me that." And
from fear of the king she murmured, just as he had
done, the three words "I give life," and fell dead.
Then the king was amazed and said: "What does
this mean?" And the Brahman related to him all
that had gone before.
"And that is why I say:
I left my family for her, ....
and the rest of it."
