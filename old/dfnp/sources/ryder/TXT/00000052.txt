THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             43
"Then summon your manhood and remain on this
spot until I return, having ascertained the nature of
the creature. Then act as seems proper." "What!"
said Rusty, "are you plucky enough to go there?"
And Victor answered: "When the master commands,
is there any difference between 'possible' and 'im-
possible' to the good servant? As the proverb says:
Good servants, when their lords command,
Behold no fear on any hand,
Cross pathless seas if he desire
Or gladly enter flaming fire.
The servant who, his lord commanding,        .
Should strive to reach an understanding
On labors hard or easy, he
King's counselor should never be."
"If you feel so, my dear fellow," said Rusty, "then
go. Blest be your journeyings."
So Victor bowed low and set out in the direction
of the sound made by Lively. And when he was gone,
terror troubled Rusty's heart, so that he thought:
"Ah, I made a sad mistake in trusting him to the
point of revealing what is in my mind. Perhaps this
Victor will betray me by taking wages from both
parties, or from spite at losing his job. For the prov-
erb says:
A servant suffering from a king
Dishonor after honoring,
Though born and trained to service, will
Be eager to destroy him still.
