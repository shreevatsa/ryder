THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            169
dunderhead! In setting these two at enmity, you
have done a wicked deed. You have brought trouble
and confusion into this entire forest, thus proving
your ignorance of the true nature of statecraft. For
the saying runs:
Those are counselors indeed,
Wise in statecraft, who succeed
In composing reckless strife
That, unhindered, threatens life:
Those on petty purpose bent,
Keen to visit punishment,
Quick in wrong and folly, bring
Risk to kingdom and to king.
Ah, poor fool!
Men of true discernment, first
Try conciliation;
For the victories of peace
Suffer no frustration.
Ah, poor simpleton! You seek the post of counselor,
and are ignorant of the very name of conciliation.
Your ambition is vain, since you love harsh measures.
As the proverb puts it:
Lord Brahma bids the statesman try
Conciliation first,
Postpone or shun (it can be done)
Harsh deeds, of all deeds worst.
'Tis neither sun nor flashing gem
Nor fiery spark,
'Tis peace, from bitter foemen's hearts
That routs the dark.
