88               THE PANCHATANTRA
said the rabbit. "Follow me, master." And he
led the way to a well, where he said to the lion:
"Master, who can endure your majesty? The moment
he saw you, that thief crawled clear into his hole.
Come, I will show him to you." "Be quick about it,
my good fellow," said Numskull.
So the rabbit showed him the well. And the lion,
being a dreadful fool, saw his own reflection in the
water, and gave voice to a great roar. Then from the
well issued a roar twice as loud, because of the echo.
This the lion heard, decided that his rival was very
powerful, hurled himself down, and met his death.
Thereupon the rabbit cheerfully carried the glad news
to all the animals, received their compliments, and
lived there contentedly in the forest.
"And that is why I say:
Intelligence is power, . ..,
and the rest of it."
"But," said Cheek, "that is like a palm-fruit
falling on a crow's head—a quite exceptional case.
Even if the rabbit was successful, still a man of feeble
powers should not deal fraudulently with the great."
And Victor retorted: "Feeble or strong, one must
make up his mind to vigorous action. You know the
proverb:
Unceasing effort brings success;
'Fate, fate is all,' let dastards wail:
Smite fate and prove yourself a man;
What fault if bold endeavor fail?
