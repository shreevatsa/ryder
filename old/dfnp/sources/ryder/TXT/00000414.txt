pared his spring beforehand. And then the lion set
the jackal on guard, and went himself to the river to
bathe. Whereupon the greedy jackal ate the donkey's
ears and heart. Now when the lion returned after'
bathing and repeating the proper prayers, he found
the donkey minus ears and heart, and his soul was
suffused with wrath, and he said to the jackal: "You
scoundrel! What is this unseemly deed? You have
eaten ears and heart, and my share is your leavings."
"O King," said the jackal respectfully, "do not
speak so. This creature was born without ears and
heart. Otherwise, how could he have come here, have
seen you with his own eyes, have run in terror, and
then come back? Why, it goes into poetry:
He came, he saw, he fled
From your appearance dread,
Returned, forgot his fears—
The fool lacked heart and ears."
So the lion was convinced by the jackal's argu-
ment, divided with him, and ate his own share with-
out suspicion.
"And that is why I say that I shall not be like the
donkey Flop-Ear. You see, you foolish fellow, you
played a trick, but spoiled it by telling the truth,
just like Fight-Firm. The saying is correct:
The heedless trickster who forgets
His own advantage, and who lets
The truth slip out, like Fight-Firm, he
Is sure to lose his victory."
