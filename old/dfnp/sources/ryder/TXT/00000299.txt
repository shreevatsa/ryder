294             THE PANCHATANTRA
Clashing with an equal foe,
Crumbles like an earthen pot.
Land and friends and gold at most
Have been won when battles cease;
If but one of these should fail,
It is best to live in peace.
When a lion digs for moles
Hiding in their pebbly house,
He is apt to break his nails,
And at best he gets a mouse.
Therefore, where no prize is won
And a healthy fight is sure,
Never stir a quarrel, but
Whatsoe'er the cost, endure.
By a stronger foe assailed,
Bend as bends the river reed;
Do not strike, as serpents do,
If you wish your luck to speed.
Imitators of the reed
Slowly win to glory's peak;
But the luckless serpent-men
Only earn the death they seek.
Shrink like turtles in their shells,
Taking blows if need there be;
Raise your head from time to time
Like the black snake, warily.
To sum it up:
Never struggle with the strong
(If you wish to know my mind)
Who has ever seen a cloud
Baffle the opposing wind ?"
