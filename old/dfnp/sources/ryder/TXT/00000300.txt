CROWS AND OWLS                295
Having heard this view, the king said to Live-
Well: "My worthy sir, I desire to hear your opinion
also." And Live-Well said: "O King, I disagree.
Inasmuch as the enemy is cruel, greedy, and unprinci-
pled, you should most certainly not make peace with
him. For the proverb says:
With foes unprincipled and false
'Tis vain to seek accommodation:
Agreements bind them not; and soon
They show a wicked transformation.
Therefore you should, in my judgment, fight with
him. You know the saying:
'Tis easy to uproot a foe
Contemning fighters, never steady,
Cruel and greedy, slothful, false,
Foolish and fearful and unready.
"But more than this—we have been humiliated by
him. Therefore, if you propose peace, he will be angry
and will employ violence again. There is a saying:
The truculence of fevered foes
By gentle measures is abetted:
What wise physician tries a douche?
He knows that fever should be sweated.
Conciliation simply makes
A foeman's indignation splutter,
Like drops of water sprinkled on
A briskly boiling pan of butter.
Besides,  the  previous  speaker's  point  about  the
strength of the enemy is not decisive.
