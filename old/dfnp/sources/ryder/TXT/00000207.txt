every heart's desire." The truth of this presentation
they all recognized, so started for Climbing Moun-
tain.
There, as fate decreed, each of them found a
priceless, magnificent gem, whereupon they debated
as follows: "How are we to guard these gems when
we leave this spot by a forest trail thick with peril ?"
Then the son of the man of learning said: "You know
I am the son of a counselor, and I have consequently
thought out an appropriate plan, namely, that we
swallow our gems and carry them in our stomachs.
Thus we shall not be an object of interest to mer-
chants, highwaymen, and other such people."
Having adopted this plan, each inserted his gem.
in a mouthful of food at dinner time, and swallowed
it. But while they were doing so, a fellow who was
resting unperceived on the mountain slope, observed
them and reflected: "Look here! I, too, have tramped
Climbing Mountain for many days, searching for
gems. But I had no luck. I found nothing. So I will
travel with them and wherever they grow weary and
go to sleep, I will cut their stomachs open and take
all three gems."
With this in mind, he came down the slope and
overtook them, saying: "Good masters, I cannot
pierce the frightful forest alone and reach my home.
Let me join your caravan and travel with you." To
this they assented, for they desired the increase of
friendliness, and the four continued their journey.
