io              THE PANCHATANTRA
This is the lofty consolation offered by a wood-
pecker to a hen-sparrow whose eggs have been crushed
by an elephant with the spring fever. And the whole

Sees no passion wane, no reigning
Love and self-control ?
Does not make the mind a menial,
Finds in virtue no congenial
Path and final goal?

For a name, and never gaining
Fame or peace of soul ?

powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity,
resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so
combined as to produce joy. It is a noble ideal, sham-
ing many tawdry ambitions, many vulgar catch-
words of our day. And this noble ideal is presented
in an artistic form of perfect fitness, in five books of
wise and witty stories, in most of which the actors are
animals.
