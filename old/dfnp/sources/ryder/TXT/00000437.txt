THE PANCHATANTRA
who was slipshod in her housekeeping, so he entered
her house every day, and ate his fill from a diversified
bill of fare. But as he left the house, other dogs,
drunk with aristocratic spleen, closed in from all
sides, and tore him in every limb with their fangs.
Then he thought: "Better one's native land,
where one lives at peace even in times of famine, and
no one picks a quarrel. It is better to return to my
own city." Having thus reasoned it through, he
returned to his own place.
Then his relatives asked him questions, as one re-
turning from foreign parts: "Come now, tell us about
it. What is the country like? How do the people
behave? What do they eat ? And what are their
habits?"
And he replied: "Why speak of the country?
The food is very good to eat
And does not lack variety;
While easy-going women meet
You in the town's society:
But kinsmen in that foreign street
Are wanting in sobriety."
So the crocodile, having received his friend's
advice, resolved to die if need be, said farewell to
the monkey, and went to his own house. There he
joined battle with the desperate ruffian who had
forced a way in, put his reliance in resolute valor,
and killed him. So he recovered his home and lived
there happily for a long time.
