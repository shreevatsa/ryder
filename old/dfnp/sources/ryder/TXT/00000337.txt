332             THE PANCHATANTRA
Thereupon he begged milk from somebody, put
it in a saucer, went to the ant-hill, and said: "O
guardian of the field! All this long time I did not
know that you were living here. Therefore I paid
you no honor. From now on, please be gracious to
me." With this he presented the milk and went home.
Now when he came back in the morning and
looked about, he found a gold dinar in the saucer. So
he went there every day alone, and offered milk, re-
ceiving a dinar each time. One day, however, the
Brahman went to town, instructing his son to carry
milk to the ant-hill. And the boy took the milk there,
set it down, and went home again.
The next day he went there, found a single dinar,
and thought: "Surely, this ant-hill is full of dinars. I
will kill that fellow and get them all." With this pur-
pose, while offering milk the next day, the Brahman's
boy struck the snake on the head with a cudgel. Yet
somehow—for fate willed it so—the snake did not die.
Instead, he furiously struck the boy with his sharp
fangs to such effect that the boy died at once. And
the relatives cremated him on a woodpile near the
field.
On the second day the father returned. And
learning from his relatives the cause of his son's
death, he found the facts as stated. And he said:
Be generous to all that lives;
Receive the needy guest:
If not, your own life fades away
Like swans from lotus nest.
