12               THE PANCHATANTRA
dignity and authority. It is as if the animals in some
English beast-fable were to justify their actions by
quotations from Shakespeare and the Bible. These
wise verses it is which make the real character of the
Panchatantra. The stories, indeed, are charming
when regarded as pure narrative; but it is the beauty,
wisdom, and wit of the verses which lift the Pan-
chatantra far above the level of the best story-books.
It hardly needs to be added that in the present ver-
sion, verse is always rendered by verse, prose by
prose. The titles of the individual stories, however,
have been supplied by the translator, since the orig-
inal has none.
The large majority of the actors are animals, who
have, of course, a fairly constant character. Thus, the
lion is strong but dull of wit, the jackal crafty, the
heron stupid, the cat a hypocrite. The animal actors
present, far more vividly and more urbanely than men
could do, the view of life here recommended—a view
shrewd, undeceived, and free of all sentimentality; a
view that, piercing the humbug of every false ideal,
reveals with incomparable wit the sources of lasting
joy.
