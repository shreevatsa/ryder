THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             63
And once again:
The sacred fires by kindly word
And Indra by the chair is stirred,
Krishna by water for the feet,
The Lord of All by things to eat."
On hearing this, the weaver said to his wife: "Go,
my dear. Take this guest to the house. Treat him hos-
pitably, giving him water for the feet, food, a bed,
and so on. And stay in the house yourself. I will
bring plenty of wine and meat for you." With this he
went farther.
So the wife started home with Godly, and she
showed a laughing countenance, for she was a whore
and had a certain swain in mind. Indeed, there is
sense in the verse:
When night is dark
And dark the day,
When streets are mired
With sticky clay,
When husband lingers
Far away,
The flirt becomes
Supremely gay.
The wench cares not
A straw to miss
The covered couch,
The husband's kiss,
The pleasant bed;
In place of this
She ever seeks
A stolen bliss.
