444             THE PANCHATANTRA
"And that is why I say:
Scholarship is less than sense, «...
and the rest of it."
But the wheel-bearer, having heard the story, re-
torted: "Not at all. The reasoning is at fault. For
creatures of very great sense perish if stricken by fate,
while those of very meager intelligence, if protected
by fate, live happily. There is a stanza:
While Hundred-Wit is on a head,
While Thousand-Wit hangs limp and dead,
Your humble Single-Wit, my dear,
Is paddling in the water clear."
"How was that?" asked the gold-finder. And the
wheel-bearer told the story of
HUNDRED-WIT, THOUSAND-WIT, AND
SINGLE-WIT
In a certain pond lived two fishes whose names
were Hundred-Wit and Thousand-Wit. And a frog
named Single-Wit made friends with them. Thus all
three would for some time enjoy at the water's edge
the pleasure of conversation spiced with witticisms,
then would dive into the water again.
One day at sunset they were engaged in conversa-
tion, when fishermen with nets came there, who said
to one another on seeing the pond: "Look! This pond
appears to contain plenty offish, and the water seems
shallow. We will return at dawn/' With this they
went home.
