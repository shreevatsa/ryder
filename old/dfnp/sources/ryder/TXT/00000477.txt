464             THE PANCHATANTRA
"Look here! Why do you run from an imaginary
danger? This is your natural food, a man. Eat
him."
On hearing this, the fiend took his own form and
turned about—but his mind was disturbed and his
purpose shaky. And when the thief saw that the
monkey had called him back, he was angry. As the
monkey sat above, and his tail hung down, the thief
took it in his mouth and started to chew very hard.
Then the monkey concluded that he was dealing with
one more powerful than the fiend, and was too fright-
ened to utter a word. In dreadful pain, he could only
shut his eyes tight, clench his teeth, and wait. And
the fiend, observing him in this state, recited the
stanza:
To judge by the expression,
Friend monkey, on your face,
You have been caught by Twilight—
He lives who wins the race.
Then the gold-finder continued: "Bid me farewell.
I desire to go home. You may stay here and taste the
fruit of the tree of your waywardness."
"Oh," said the wheel-bearer, "that is uncalled for.
Good or evil comes by fate's decree to men well-be-
haved or wayward. As the old verse puts it:
Blind man, hunchback, and unblest
Princess with an extra breast—
Waywardness is prudence, when
Fortune favors wayward men."
