50              THE PANCHATANTRA
why should I grow thin? It does me no good. For
I cannot possibly hurt him. And there is sense in the
saying:
Indulge no angry, shameless wish
To hurt, unless you can:
The chick-pea, hopping up and down,
Will crack no frying-pan."
Now one morning, as he was sweeping near the
bed where the king lay half awake, he said: "What
impudence! Strong-Tooth kisses the queen." When
the king heard this, he jumped up in a hurry, crying:
"Come, come, Bull! Is that thing true that you were
muttering? Has the queen been kissed by Strong-
Tooth?"
"O King," answered Bull, "I was awake all night
because I am passionately fond of gambling. So sleep
overpowered me even when I was busy with my
sweeping. I do not know what I said."
But the jealous king thought: "Yes, he has free
entrance to my palace. So has Strong-Tooth. Per-
haps he actually saw the fellow hugging the queen.
For the proverb says:
Whate'er a man desires, sees, does
In broad daylight,
Still mindful, he will say or do
Asleep at night.
And again:
Whatever secrets, good or ill,
Men in their bosoms keep,
Are soon betrayed when they are drunk
Or talking in their sleep.
