THE LOSS OF FRIENDS           131
could aim by sound. This archer strung his powerful
bow, drew an arrow as far as his ear, and killed the
swan, who was resting near the owl's nest.
"And that is why I say:
Harsh talk, untimely action,. ...
and the rest of it."
And Lively continued: "Why, our master Rusty
was all honey at first, but at the last his purpose turns
to poison. Ah, yes!
He compliments you to your face;
His whispered slanders never stop:
Avoid a friend like that. He is
A poison-jug with cream on top.
"Yes, I have learned by experience the truth of
the well-known verse:
He lifts his hands to see you standing there;
His eyes grow moist; he offers half his chair;
He hugs you warmly to his eager breast;
In kindly talk and question finds no rest;
His skill is wondrous in deceptive tricks;
Honey without, within the poison sticks:
What play is this, what strange dramatic turns,
That every villain, like an actor, learns?
At first rogues' friendship glitters bright
With service, flattery, delight;
Thence, in its middle journey, shoot
Gay flowers of speech that fail to fruit;
Its final goal is treason, shame,
Disgust, and slanders that defame:
Alas! Who made the curs&d thing?
Its one foul purpose is to sting.
