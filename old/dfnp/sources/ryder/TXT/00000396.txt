gether." "Friend Handsome," said Theodore, "I
will take you there by an easy way and show you the
resting-place. But you must spare my family. You
must not eat any except those I point out."
"My dear fellow," said the snake, "you and I are
now friends. Have no fear. I will do nothing but
what you wish."
Then he came out of his hole, hugged the frog,
and started off with him. So they came to the edge
of the well, and the snake went in with the frog by
way of the buckets on the water-wheel. Then Theo-

him the relatives. And he ate them all one after

the buckets."

serious mistake. How can I go home? My hole was
my fortress, and it Is surely occupied by strangers.
