344             THE PANCHATANTRA
Then someone pitied him and gave him two calves.
And the Brahman began when they were little and
fed them on butter and oil and fodder and other
things that he begged. So he made them very plump.
Then a thief saw them and the idea came to him
at once: "I will steal these two cows from this Brah-
man." So he took a rope and set out at night. But
on the way he met a fellow with a row of sharp teeth
set far apart, with a high-bridged nose and uneven
eyes, with limbs covered with knotty muscles, with
hollow cheeks, with beard and body as yellow as a
fire with much butter in it.
And when the thief saw him, he started with acute
fear and said: "Who are you, sir?"
The other said: "I am a ghost named Truthful.
It is now your turn to explain yourself."
The thief said: "I am a thief, and my acts are
cruel. I am on my way to steal two cows from a poor
Brahman."
Then the ghost felt relieved and said: "My dear
sir, I take one meal every three days. So I will just
eat this Brahman today. It is delightful that you and
I are on the same errand."
So together they went there and hid, waiting
for the proper moment. And when 'the Brahman
went to sleep, the ghost started forward to eat him.
But the thief saw him and said: "My dear sir, this is
not right. You are not to eat the Brahman until I
have stolen his two cows."
