and wandered into the city after nightfall. There the
city dogs snapped at his limbs with their sharp-
pointed teeth, and terrified his heart with their dread-
ful barking, so that he stumbled this way and that in
his efforts to escape and happened into the house of
a dyer. There he tumbled into a tremendous indigo
vat, and all the dogs went home.
Presently the jackal—further life being predes-
tined—managed to crawl out of the indigo vat and
escaped into the forest. There all the thronging ani-
mals in his vicinity caught a glimpse of his body dyed
with the juice of indigo, and crying out: "What is
this creature enriched with that unprecedented
color?" they fled, their eyes dancing with terror, and
spread the report: "Oh, oh! Here is an exotic crea-
ture that has dropped from somewhere. Nobody
knows what his conduct might be, or his energy. We
are going to vamoose. For the proverb says:
Where you do not know
Conduct, stock, and pluck,
*Tis not wise to trust,
If you wish for luck."
Now Fierce-Howl perceived their dismay, and
called to them: "Come, come, you wild things! Why
do you flee in terror at sight of me? For Indra, real-
izing that the forest creatures have no monarch,
anointed me—my name is Fierce-Howl—as your
king. Rest in safety within the cage formed by my
resistless paws."
