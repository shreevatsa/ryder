CROWS AND OWLS                 329
panic-stricken, is in full flight, and can be readily
caught. For the proverb says:
In flight, a fort becomes a trap
Where all defense is lacking;
'Tis easy then to beat a king
Whose men are busy packing."
With this battle-cry they flew to attack the ban-
yan tree. And failing to find a single crow, King Foe-
Crusher gleefully perched on a branch, and while the
court poets chanted flatteries, he gave orders: "Ho
there! Discover their line of retreat. Before they
establish themselves in a fort, I will be at their heels
and will kill them."
At this point Live-Strong reflected: "If the enemy
simply go home after learning what we have done, I
shall have accomplished nothing. For the proverb
says:
The first or second evidence
Of genuine intelligence
Is—leave a business unbegun,
Or, if begun, then see it done.
It would have been better not to undertake this than
to see the undertaking fail. I will reveal myself by
letting them hear me caw."
So he cawed with a feeble squeak. And the owls,
hearing this, started up to kill him. But Live-Strong
said: "Gentlemen, I am Cloudy's minister, Live-
Strong, reduced to this state by Cloudy himself.
Pray inform your own king. I have much to discuss
with him."
