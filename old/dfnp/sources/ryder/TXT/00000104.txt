THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             95
mount the bird and insert a plug, it goes wherever you.
wish. And the contrivance alights at the spot where
you pull out the plug. It is yours. This very night,
when people are asleep, adorn your person, disguise
yourself as Vishnu—my wit and skill are at your serv-
ice—mount this Garuda bird, alight on the maidens'
balcony of the palace, and make whatever arrange-
ments you like with the princess. I have ascertained
that the princess sleeps alone on the palace balcony."
When the carpenter had gone, the weaver spent
the rest of the day in a hundred fond imaginings. He
took a bath, used incense, powders, ointments, betel,
scents for the breath, flowers, and so forth. He put on
gay garlands and garments, rich in fragrance. He
adorned himself with a diadem and other jewelry.
And when the night came clear, he followed the
carpenter's instructions.
Meanwhile, the princess lay in her bed alone on
the palace balcony bathed in moonbeams. She gazed
at the moon, her mind idly dallying with the thought
of love. All at once she spied the weaver, disguised
as Vishnu and mounted on his heavenly bird. At
sight of him she started from her bed, adored his feet,
and humbly said: "O Lord, to what end am I honored
by this visit? Pray command me. What am I to do?"
To the princess' words the weaver, in dignified and
sweetly modulated accents, made stately answer:
"Yourself, dear maiden, are the occasion of this visit
to earth." "But I am merely a mortal girl/' said she.
