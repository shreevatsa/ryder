the bed. This flea felt supreme satisfaction on exam-
ining the bed—the wonderful delicacy of its coverlet,
its double pillow, its exceptional softness like that of
a broad, Gangetic sand-bank, its delicious perfume.
Charmed by the sheer delight of touching it, he
hopped this way and that until—fate willed it so—he
chanced to meet Creep, who said to him: "Where
do you come from? This is a dwelling fit for a king.
Begone, and lose no time about it/' "Madam," said
he, "you should not say such things. For
The Brahman reverences fire,
Himself the lower castes' desire;
The wife reveres her husband dear;
But all the world must guests revere.
Now I am your guest. I have of late sampled the va-
rious blood of Brahmans, warriors, business men, and
serfs, but found it acid, slimy, quite unwholesome.
On the contrary, he who reposes on this bed must
have a delightful vital fluid, just like nectar. It must
be free from morbidity, since wind, bile, and phlegm
are kept in harmony by constant and heedful use of
potions prepared by physicians. It must be enriched
by viands unctuous, tender, melting in the mouth;
viands prepared from the flesh of the choicest crea-
tures of land, water, and air, seasoned furthermore
with sugar, pomegranate, ginger, and pepper. To me
it seems an elixir of life. Therefore, with your kind
permission, I plan to taste this sweet and fragrant
substance, thus combining pleasure and profit."
