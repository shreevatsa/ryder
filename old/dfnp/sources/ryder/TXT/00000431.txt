4i6             THE PANCHATANTRA
One day in the month of February a monkey took
shelter under the tree; for he had been caught in an
unseasonable hail-storm, and his body shivered to
the slightest breeze. Since his teeth were making
music and his face was woebegone and his hands and
feet were tightly clenched, the hen-sparrow said to
him compassionately:
With hands and feet of human plan,
Almost you seem to be a man.
So, if you find the weather cool,
Why not construct a house, you fool?
When the monkey heard this, he reflected: "Well,
well, some people fancy themselves. Here is this
paltry hen-sparrow who has a good opinion of her
own judgment. The well-known saying is correct:
Of self-conceit all creatures show
An adequate supply:
The plover lies with claws upstretched
To prop the falling sky."
Thereupon he said to her:
You slut! You wench! You smarty!
You needle-face! Be still,
Or I will spoil the party;
I will, I will, I will.
But she continued to ply him with excellent ad-
vice concerning the construction of a house, even
after he had thus requested her not to do so. So he
climbed the tree and destroyed her nest, breaking it
to bits.
