LOSS OF GAINS                   385
The Brahman-murderer or thief,
Drunkard or liar, finds relief;
While for ingratitude alone
No expiation will atone.
"'I regard this monkey as my brother-in-law. So
bring him home, and we will make some return for
his kindness. If you refuse, I will see you later in
heaven.' Now I could not come to you until she had
finished her scolding. And this long time passed while
I was quarreling with her about you. So please come
home with me. Your brother's wife has set up an
awning. She has fixed her clothes and gems and
rubies and all that, to pay you a fitting welcome. She
has hung holiday garlands on the doorposts. And
she is waiting impatiently."
"My friend and brother," said the monkey,
"your lady is very kind. It is quite according to the
proverb:
Six things are done by friends:
To take, and give again;
To listen, and to talk;
To dine, to entertain.
"But we monkeys live in trees, and your home is
in the water. How can I go there? Rather bring
your lady here, brother, that I may bow down and
receive her blessing."
The crocodile said: "My friend, our home is on a
lovely sand-bank under the water. So climb on my
back and travel comfortably with nothing to fear."
