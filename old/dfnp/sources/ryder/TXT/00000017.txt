8                 THE PANCHATANTRA
A noble purpose to attain
Desiderates extended pain,
Asks man's full greatness, pluck, and care,
And loved ones aiding with a prayer.
Yet if it climb to heart's desire,
What man of pride and fighting fire,
Of passion and of self-esteem
Can bear the unaccomplished dream?
His heart indignantly is bent
(Through its achievement) on content.
Equal stress is laid upon the winning and holding
of intelligent friends. The very name of the second
book is "The Winning of Friends"; the name of the
first book is "The Loss of Friends." Throughout the
whole work, we are never permitted to be long ob-
livious of the rarity, the necessity, and the priceless-
ness of friendship with the excellent. For, indeed,
The days when meetings do not fail
With wise and good
Are lovely clearings on the trail
Through life's wild wood.
So speaks Slow, the turtle; and Swift, the crow, ex-
presses it thus:
They taste the best of bliss, are good,
And find life's truest ends,
Who, glad and gladdening, rejoice
In love, with loving friends.
Last of all, and in a sense including all else, is the
use of the intelligence. Without it, no human joy is
possible, nothing beyond animal happiness.
