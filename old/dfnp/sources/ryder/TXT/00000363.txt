358             THE PANCHATANTRA
of their race.   And on  the journey Live-Strong
laughed in his heart and said:
The secrets of diplomacy
To him alone were plain
Who, instant in his master's cause,
Advised that I be slain.
"Now if they were to take his advice, not even
the slightest misfortune would befall them."
When they came to the fortress gate, Foe-Crusher
said: "Come, my friends! Give this Live-Strong
whatever chamber he prefers—for he wishes us well."
And Live-Strong, hearing this, reflected: "I must
now devise a plan for their destruction. This is not
possible if I live in their midst. For they would ob-
serve motions betraying my purpose, and would
keep their eyes open. Only by remaining near the
gate can I accomplish my desire."
He therefore said to the owl-king: "O King, what
the king has said, is eminently right. Yet I, too, am a
student of diplomacy and a well-wisher. I know that
even one who is loyal and pure in purpose should not
dwell in the heart of a fortress. I will therefore take
my place here at the fortress gate and pay daily
homage, my body sanctified by the dust from your
lotus feet."
To this the owl-king agreed, and his efficient
caterers daily gave Live-Strong, by special command
of the king, the pick of the viands. So that in a very
few days he grew strong as a peacock.
