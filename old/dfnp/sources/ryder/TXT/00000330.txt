CROWS AND OWLS                325
The dog and the rooster,
The hangman, the ass,
The camel, defile you:
Don't touch them, but pass."
At that the Brahman was mastered by anger, and
he said: "Are you blind, man, that you impute dog-
hood to a goat?" "O Brahman," said the rogue, "do
not be angry. Go whither you will."
But when he had traveled a little farther, the
second rogue met him and said: "Alas, holy sir, alas!
Even if this dead calf was a pet, still you should not
put it on your shoulder. For the proverb says:
Touch not unwisely man or beast
That lifeless lie;
Else, gifts of milk and lunar fast
Must purify."
Then the Brahman spoke in anger: "Are you
blind, man? You call a goat a calf." And the rogue
said: "Holy sir, do not be angry. I spoke in ignorance.
Do as you will."
But when he had walked only a little farther
through the forest, the third rogue, changing his
dress, met him and said: "Sir, this is most improper.
You are carrying a donkey on your shoulder. Yet the
proverb tells you:
If you should touch an ass—be it
In ignorance or not—
You needs must wash your clothes and bathe,
To cleanse the sinful spot.
Pray drop this thing, before another sees you."
