overflowing with joy, he questioned Live-Strong in
full session of his court: "Father, how did you pass
the time in the midst of the enemy? For the proverb
Better a plunge in blazing fire
(The righteous know)
Than momentary contact with
A wicked foe."
And Live-Strong said: "My lord and king!
Whatever path provides escape
When danger's face is seen,
With clear decision follow, if
It noble seem, or mean:
Two arms like trunks of elephants,
Fight-calloused, skilled to wield
The bow of heaven, Arjun felt
To woman's bracelets yield.
The wise and strong, awaiting days
More prosperous, must grant
Obedience to wicked lords
Whose speech is adamant:
Gigantic Bhima, smoke-begrimed,
Puffing at labor, and
A ladle flourished in his fist,
Was cook in Matsya land.
The prudent, hopeful man should act
As suits an evil case,
Should steel his heart to carry through
A holy deed, or base:
Great Arjun with a calloused arm
From twanging bow divine
Effeminately danced, and saw
His tinkling girdle shine.
