LOSS OF GAINS                   413
Then at night, while her husband slept, she took
all the money, and reached the rendezvous at dawn.
The rogue, for his part, put her in front, started
south, and traveled two leagues, gaily enjoying the
delights of conversation with her. But when he saw
a river ahead, he reflected: "What am I to do with
this middle-aged female? Besides, someone might
perhaps pursue her. I will just take her money and
be off."
So he said to her: "My dear, this is a great river,
hard to cross. I will just take the money and put it
safe on the far bank, then return to carry you alone
on my back, and so transport you in comfort." "Do
so, my beloved," said she.
So he took the money to the last penny, and then
he said: "Dearest, hand me your dress and your
wrap, too, so that you may travel through the water
unembarrassed." And when she did so, the rogue
took the money and the two garments and went to
the place he had in mind.
Then the farmer's wife sat down woebegone on
the river-bank, digging her two hands into her throat.
At that moment a she-jackal came to the spot, carry-
ing a piece of meat. As she came up and peered about,
a great fish leaped from the water and was stranded
on the bank. On spying him, she dropped the meat
and darted at the fish. Whereupon a vulture swooped
from the sky and flew off with the meat. And the
fish, perceiving the jackal, struggled into the river.
