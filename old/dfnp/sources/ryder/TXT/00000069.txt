60              THE PANCHATANTRA
"My son," answered Godly, "I am ready to oblige
you. But you must not enter my cell by night. For
renunciation is recommended to ascetics, to you and
to me as well. As the proverb puts it:
Ascetics come to grief through greed;
And kings, who evil counsels heed;
Children through petting, wives through wine,
Through wicked sons a noble line;
A Brahman through unstudied books,
A character through haunting crooks;
A farm is ruined through neglect;
And friendship, lacking kind respect;
Love dies through absence; fortunes crash
Through naughtiness; and hoarded cash
Through carelessness or giving rash.
So, after taking the vow, you must sleep in a hut of
thatch at the monastery gate."
"Holy sir," said the other, "your prescription is
the law of my life. I shall need it in the next world."
So, the sleeping arrangements being made, Godly
graciously gave him initiation and granted disciple-
ship. June for his part made the holy man very happy
by rubbing his hands and feet, bringing writing-
paper, and other services. Still, Godly kept his treas-
ure under his arm.
As the time passed in this manner, June reflected:
"Dear me! Do what I will, he does not trust me. So
shall I kill him with a knife in broad daylight? Or
give him poison? Or butcher him like a beast?"
While he was reflecting thus, the son of a pupil of
Godly's came from the village, bearing an invitation.
