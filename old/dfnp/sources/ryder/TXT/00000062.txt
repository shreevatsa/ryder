THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             53
Though fashioned on a cowardly plan
And mean, a royal servant can
Resent affronts from any man."
After this lamentation he went home, abashed and
deeply stirred. Then he summoned Bull in the eve-
ning, gave him two garments as an honorable present,
and said: "My good fellow, I did not drive you out
by order of the king. It was because I saw you, in the
chaplain's presence, sitting where you did not belong,
that I humiliated you."
Now Bull received the two garments as if they
were the Kingdom of Heaven, and feeling intense
satisfaction, he said: "Friend merchant, I forgive
you. You will soon see the reward of the honor shown
me in the king's favor and such things." With this
he departed in high glee. For there is wisdom in the
saying:
A little thing will lift him high,
A little make him fall:
'Twixt balance-beam and scamp there is
No difference at all.
On the next day Bull entered the palace, and did
his sweeping. And while the king lay half awake, he
said: "What intelligence! When our king sits at stool,
he eats a cucumber."
Now the king, hearing this, rose in amazement and
said: "Come, come, Bull! What twaddle is this? But
I remember that you are a house-servant and do not
kill you. Did you ever see me engaged in that occupa-
tion?"
