458             THE PANCHATANTRA
If foes commit an outrage on
A house, and one forgives—
Be it from fear or greed—he is
The meanest man that lives.
Now as the elderly monkey wandered about
thirsty, he came to a lake made lovely by clusters of

footprints leading into the lake, but none coming out.
Thereupon he reflected: "There must be some vicious
beast here in the water. So I will stay at a safe dis-

When he had done so, there issued from the water
a man-eating fiend with a pearl necklace adorning his
neck, who spoke and said: "Sir, I eat everyone who
enters the water. So there is none shrewder than you,
who drink in this fashion. I have taken a liking to
you. Name your heart's desire."
"Sir, " said the monkey, "how many can you eat?"
And the fiend replied: "I can eat hundreds, thou-
sands, myriads, yes, hundreds of thousands, if they
enter the water. Outside, a jackal can overpower
me."
"And I," said the monkey, "I live in mortal
enmity with a king. If you will give me that pearl
necklace, I will awaken his greed with a plausible nar-
