154             THE PANCHATANTRA
the parent-birds—further life being predestined—
barely escaped death.
Then the hen-sparrow lamented, desolate with
grief at the death of her chicks. And presently, hear-
ing her lamentation, a woodpecker bird, a great friend
of hers, came grieved at her grief, and said: "My dear
friend, why lament in vain? For the Scripture says:
For lost and dead and past
The wise have no laments:
Between the wise and fools
Is just this difference.
And again:
No life deserves lament;
Fools borrow trouble,
Add sadness to the sad,
So make it double.
And yet again:
Since kinsmen's sticky tears
Clog the departed,
Bury them decently,
Tearless, whole-hearted."
"That is good doctrine," said the hen-sparrow,
"but what of it? This elephant—curse his spring
fever!—killed my babies. So if you are my friend,
think of some plan to kill this big elephant. If that
were done, I should feel less grief at the death of my
children. You know the saying:
While one brings comfort in distress,
Another jeers at pain;
By paying both as they deserve,
A man is born again."
