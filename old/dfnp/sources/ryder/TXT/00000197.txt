statement, their eyes blossomed with astonishment,
and they searched their minds to discover the ap-
propriate legal penalty for stealing money, in order
to visit it on Right-Mind.
Meanwhile Right-Mind heaped inflammable mat-
ter about the hole in the mimosa and set fire to it.
As the mimosa burned, Wrong-Mind's father issued
from the hole with a pitiful wail, his body scorched
and his eyes popping out. And they all asked: "Why,
sir! What does this mean?"
"It is all Wrong-Mind's doing," he replied.
Whereupon the king's men hanged Wrong-Mind to a
branch of the mimosa, while they commended Right-
Mind and caused him satisfaction by conferring upon
him the king's favor and other things.
"And that is why I say:
Right-mind was one, and Wrong-mind two, ....
and the rest of it."
After telling the story, Cheek continued: "Poor
fool! By your oversubtle wisdom you have burned
your own family. Yes, there is wisdom in the saying:
Rivers find their ending
In the salty sea;
Household peace, as soon as
Women disagree;
Secrets end that do not
Every traitor shun;
Families are ended
In a wicked son.
