THE WINNING OF FRIENDS        253
True learning 'tis, to cease from wrong;
Contentment is prosperity.
And again:
Yes, all prosperities are his,
Whose heart is filled with mirth:
The feet in leather sandals shod,
Travel a leather earth.
A hundred leagues is naught to him
Whose vehicle is greed:
To clasp the wealth that fingers touch
Contentment has no need.
Since Vishnu, universal lord,
Through thee a dwarf was made,
0 manhood's solvent, Greed divine,
To thee be homage paid.
No feat is hard for thee, O Greed,
Dishonor's wedded dame,
Who, for the men of kindest heart,
Preparest draughts of shame.
What man should never bear, I bore;
I spoke and, speaking, lied;
1  waited at the stranger's door:
O Greed, be satisfied!
And again:
I've drunk foul water; slept forlorn
On gathered bits of broken thorn;
I've lost my love, I've begged for alms,
Enduring heart- and belly-qualms;
I've crossed the sea; I've walked afar;
I've treasured half a shattered jar:
Of further labors is there need?
Quick, damn you! Give your orders, Greed!
