go with his wife into the forest, where he cut great
anjana logs. Now in that forest lived a lion named
Spotless, who had as hangers-on two carnivorous
creatures, a jackal and a crow.
One day the lion was roaming the wood alone and
encountered the carpenter. The carpenter for his
part, on beholding that most alarming lion, whether
considering himself already lost or perhaps with the
ready wit to perceive that it is safer to face the
powerful, advanced to meet the lion, bowed low, and
said: "Come, friend, come! Today you must eat my
own dinner which my wife—your brother's wife—
has provided."
"My good fellow," said the lion, "being carnivor-
ous, I do not live on rice. But in spite of that, I will
have a taste, since I take a fancy to you. What kind
of dainty have you got?"
When the lion had spoken, the carpenter stuffed
him with all kinds of dainties—buns, muffins, chew-
ers, and things, all flavored with sugar, butter, grape-
juice, and spice. And to show his gratitude, the lion
guaranteed his safety and granted unhindered pas*
sage through the forest. Then the carpenter said:
"Comrade, you must come here every day, but please
come alone. You must not bring anyone else to visit
me." In this manner they spent their days in friend-
ship. And the lion, since every day he received such
hospitality, such a variety of goodies, gave up the
practice of hunting.
