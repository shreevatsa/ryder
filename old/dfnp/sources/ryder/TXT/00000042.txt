THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             33
One who finds in battle, peace
Free from questionings,
Thinks of exile as of home,
Is beloved of kings.
One who thinks of dice as death,
Wine as poison-stings,
Others' wives as statues, he
Is beloved of kings."
"Well," said Cheek, "when you come into his pres-
ence, what do you intend to say first? Please tell me
that." And Victor replied:
"Answers, after speech begins,
Further answers breed,
As a seed, with timely rain,
Ripens other seed.
And besides:
A clever servant shows his master
The gleam of triumph or disaster
From good or evil courses springing,
And shows him wit, decision-bringing.
The man possessing such a wit
Should magnify and foster it;
Thereby he earns a livelihood
And public honor from the good.
And there is a saying:
Let anyone who does not seek
His master's fall, unbidden speak;
So act at least the excellent:
The other kind are different."
