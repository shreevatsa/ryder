mine. He will cut our bonds in a hurry. He is quite
competent to set us free from our trouble."
So they all did as he said, for they were eager to
find the mouse named Gold. And when they reached
the hole which he had converted into a fortress, they
alighted. Now previously
The mouse, in social ethics skilled,
Saw danger coming. Then
He built and was residing in
A hundred-gated den.
This being so, Gold was alarmed at the whir of
birds' wings, darted along one path in his fortress-
den until just beyond reach of a cat's paw, and re-
mained on the qui vive, wondering what it meant. But
Gay-Neck took his stand at a gate of the den, and
said: "My dear Gold, pray hasten to me. See what a
plight I am in."
Thereupon Gold, still within his fortress, said:
"My good sir, who are you? What is your errand?
And of what nature is your misfortune? Please in-
form me." And Gay-Neck answered: "Why, my
name is Gay-Neck. I am king of the doves, and a
friend of yours. Hasten to me." At this the mouse
felt a quiver in his body and a thrill in his soul. He
hastened forth, saying:
If daily to his home
The friends who love him come,
And coming, bring delight
To eyes that kindle bright,
A man has found the whole
Of life within his soul.
