62               THE PANCHATANTRA
Godly said: "The jackal at the ram-fight," and griev-
ing for him, started to resume his treasure.
He returned in no haste, but when he failed to
find June, he hurried through a ceremony of purifica-
tion, then examined his robe. Finding the treasure
gone, he fell to the ground in a swoon, murmuring:
"Oh, oh! I am robbed." In a moment he came to
himself, rose again, and started to scream: "June,
June! Where did you go after cheating me ? Give me
answer!" With this repeated lamentation he moved
slowly on, picking up his disciple's tracks and mutter-
ing: "And we, when tricked by June."
THE WEAVER'S WIFE
Now as he walked along, Godly spied a weaver
who with his wife was on his way to a neighboring
city for liquor to drink, and he called out: "Look
here, my good fellow! I come to you a guest, brought
by the evening sun. I do not know a soul in the vil-
lage. Let me receive the treatment due a guest. For
the proverb says:
No stranger may be turned aside
Who seeks your door at eventide;
Nay, honor him and you shall be
Transmuted into deity.
And again:
Some straw, a floor, and water,
With kindly words beside:
These four are never wanting
Where pious folk abide.
