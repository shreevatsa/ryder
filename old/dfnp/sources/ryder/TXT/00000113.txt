io4             THE PANCHATANTRA
While the very gods were thus pondering with
tense interest, the weaver hurled his discus at Valor.
This discus, after cutting the king in twain, returned
to his hand. At the sight, all the kings without ex-
ception leaped from their vehicles, and with hands,
feet, and head drooping in limp obeisance, they im-
plored him who bore the form of Vishnu: "O Lord,
An army, leaderless, is slain.
Be mindful of this and spare our lives. Command us.
What are we to do?"
So spoke the whole throng of kings, until he made
answer who bore the form of Vishnu: "Your persons
are secure henceforth. Whatever commands you re-
ceive from the local king, King Stout-Mail, you must
on all occasions unhesitatingly perform." And all the
kings humbly received his instructions, saying: "Let
it be as our Lord commands."
Thereupon the weaver bestowed on Stout-Mail
all his rival's wealth, whether men or elephants or
chariots or horses or stores of merchandise or other
riches, while he himself, having attained the special
majesty of those victorious, enjoyed all known de-
lights with the princess.
"And that is why I say:
The gods befriend a man who climbs
Determination's height, ....
and the rest of it."
