THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             109
"Again, any pity that our lord and king might feel
toward him, is quite out of place. For
Whoever leaves the righteous path
For some unrighteous course,
Will meet calamity in time
And suffer much remorse.
Whoever will not take from friends
Most excellent advice,
Will gladden foes, and falling soon,
Will pay his folly's price.
And again:
On wicked trick intently bent,
The wilful still lack ear to hear
(So blind their mind) of nice and vice
The cause in saws appearing clear.
Furthermore:
Where one will speak and one will heed
What in the end is well,
Although unpleasant at the time,
There riches love to dwell.
And again:
No king's retainer should devise
A fraud, for spies are kingly eyes:
Then bear with harsh as kind, O King;
The truth is seldom flattering.
Tried servants never should be left,
And strangers taken;
A kingdom's health by no disease
Is sooner shaken."
