his advisers, and his material resources. I plan to kill
him and to seize the royal power myself without diffi-
culty/ This very day this Lively person intends to
carry out his design. That is why I am here to warn
the master whose service is mine by inheritance."
To Rusty this report was more terrible than the
fall of a thunderbolt. He sank into a panic-stricken
stupor and said not a word. Then Victor, compre-
hending his state of mind, continued: "This is the
great sadness in the discharge of a counselor's duty.
There is wisdom in the saying:
When a counselor or king
Rises higher than he should,
Fortune strives in vain to make
Still her double footing good;
Being woman, feels the strain;
Soon abandons one of twain.
For, indeed,
With broken sliver, loosened tooth,
Or counselor who fails in truth,
Pull roots and all; so only, grief
Will find its permanent relief.
And again:
No king should ever delegate
To one sole man the powers of state:
For folly seizes him, then pride,
Whereat he grows dissatisfied
With service; thus impatient grown,
He longs to rule the realm alone;
And such impatient longings bring
Him into plots to kill his king.
