52               THE PANCHATANTRA
What beggar can be dignified?
Whose heart no woman stings?
Who, trapped by scamps, comes safely off?
Who is beloved of kings?
And again:
Who ever saw or heard
A gambler's truthful word,
A neat and cleanly crow,
A woman going slow
In love, a kindly snake,
A eunuch's pluck awake,
A drunkard's love of science,
A king in friends' alliance?
And yet I never committed an unfriendly act against
the king—or anyone else—not even in a dream, not
even by mere words. So why does the king withdraw
his favor from me?"
Now one day Bull, the sweeper, saw Strong-
Tooth stopped at the palace gate, and he laughed
aloud, saying to the doorkeepers: "Be careful, door-
keepers! This fellow Strong-Tooth's temper has been
spoiled by the king's favor and he dispenses arrests
and releases. If you stop him, you will get a cuffing,
just like me."
And Strong-Tooth reflected on hearing this: "1
see. It was Bull's doing. Well, there is sense in the
proverb:
Though foolish, base, and lacking pride,
A servant at the monarch's side
Will have his honor satisfied.
