THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             39
Rusty, concealing his inner feelings, said: "Victor,
it just happened so." "O King," said the jackal, "if
it is not a thing to disclose, then let it be.
Some things a man should tell his wife,
Some things to friend and some to son;
All these are trusted. He should not
Tell everything to everyone."
Hereupon Rusty reflected: "He seems trust-
worthy. I will tell him what I have in mind. For the
proverb says:
You find repose, in sore disaster,
By telling things to powerful master,
To honest servant, faithful friend,
Or wife who loves you till the end.
Friend Victor, did you hear a great voice in the dis-
tance?" "Yes, master, I did," said Victor. "What
of it?"
And Rusty continued: "My good fellow, I in-
tend to leave this forest." "Why?" said Victor. "Be-
cause," said Rusty, "there has come into our forest
some prodigious creature, from whom we hear this
great voice. His nature must correspond to his voice,
and his power to his nature."
"What!" said Victor. "Is our master frightened
by a mere voice? You know the proverb:
Water undermines the dikes;
Love dissolves when malice strikes;
Secrets melt when babblings start;
Simple words melt dastard hearts.
