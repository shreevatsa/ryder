THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             73
Cy there arises the vicious situation called 'cor-
ruption/
" 'Attachment* was explained above, in the words:
Drink, women, hunting,
and the rest of it. Here there is a love-group (drink,
women, hunting, dice) and a wrath-group (scolding,
and the rest). A man thwarted in the love-group be-
comes obnoxious to the wrath-group. The love-group
requires no elucidation. The wrath-group, however,
threefold as already described, needs some further
characterization. 'Scolding' is ill-considered imputa-
tion of fault on the part of one bent on injuring an
antagonist. 'Cruelty* means ruthless and unwar-
ranted refinements in putting to death, imprison-
ment, mutilation. 'Greed* is covetousness pushed to
a merciless point. These are the seven subdivisions
of the vice of attachment.
"Next, there are eight kinds of devastation: by act
of God, fire, water, disease, plague, panic, famine,
devil-rain (which is a mere name for excessive rain).
This disposes of the vice called 'devastation/
"Finally, there is mistaken policy. Where a man
makes a mistaken use of the six expedients—peace,
war, change of base, entrenchment, alliance, dupli-
city—adopting war instead of peace, or peace instead
of war, or making similar mistakes in regard to the
other expedients, there we have the vice of mistaken
policy.
