ILL-CONSIDERED ACTION         443
Then the second said: "My intelligent friend, you
lack scholarship. Please go home." But the third
said: "No, no. This is no way to behave. For we
have played together since we were little boys. Come
along, my noble friend. You shall have a share of the
money we earn."
With this agreement they continued their journey,
and in a forest they found the bones of a dead lion.
Thereupon one of them said: "A good opportunity to
test the ripeness of our scholarship. Here lies some
kind of creature, dead. Let us bring it to life by means
of the scholarship we have honestly won."
Then the first said: "I know how to assemble the
skeleton." The second said: "I can supply skin,
flesh, and blood." The third said: "I can give it life."
So the first assembled the skeleton, the second
provided skin, flesh, and blood. But while the third
was intent on giving the breath of life, the man of
sense advised against it, remarking: "This is a lion.
If you bring him to life, he will kill every one of
us."
"You simpleton!" said the other, "it is not I who
will reduce scholarship to a nullity." "In that case,"
came the reply, "wait a moment, while I climb this
convenient tree."
When this had been done, the lion was brought to
life, rose up, and killed all three. But the man of
sense, after the lion had gone elsewhere, climbed down
and went home.
