THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            127
good fellow, what you wish to imply." And Victor
answer^: "Well, you are my friend. I cannot help
telling *^5u what is to your profit. Here goes. The
master, Rusty, is filled with wrath against you. And
he said today: 'I will kill Lively and provide a feast
for all who eat meat.' Of course, I fell into deep dejec-
tion on hearing this. Now you must do what the
crisis demands."
To Lively this report was like the fall of a thunder-
bolt, and he fell into deep dejection. Yet as Victor's
words were always plausible, he grew more and more
troubled, fell into a panic, and said: "Yes, the proverb
is right:
Women oft are tricked by scamps;
Kings with rascals oft agree;
Toward the skinflints money drifts;
Rain on mountains falls and sea.
Ah, me! Ah, me! What is this that has befallen me?
You serve your king most heedfully.
Of course. Who could complain?
But enmity as your reward
Is unexpected pain.
And again:
If one is angry, giving cause,
Remove it, and the wrath will pause:
But how may man propitiate
A mind that harbors causeless hate?
Who does not fear the scoundrel's art,
The causeless hate, the flinty heart?
For ever ready venom drips
Resistless from his serpent-lips.
