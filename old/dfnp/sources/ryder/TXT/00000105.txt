96              THE PANCHATANTRA
And he continued: "Nay, you have been my bride,
now fallen to earth by reason of a curse. It is I who
have so long protected you from contact with a man.
I will now wed you by the ceremony used in heaven."
And she assented, for she thought: "It is a thing
beyond my fondest aspirations." And he married her
by the ceremony used in heaven.
So day followed day in the enjoyment of love's
delights, each day witnessing a growth in passion.
Before dawn the weaver would mount his mechan-
ical Garuda, would bid her farewell with the words:
"I depart for Vishnu's heaven," and would always
reach his house undetected.
One day the guards at the women's quarters ob-
served indications that the princess was meeting a
man, and in fear of their very lives made a report to
their master. "O King," they said, "be gracious and
confirm our personal security. There is a disclosure
to be made." And when the king assented, the guards
reported: "O King, we have used anxious care to
forbid the entrance of men. Yet indications are ob-
served that Princess Lovely has meetings with a man.
Not unto us does it fall to take measures. The king,
the king alone is prime mover."
Upon this information the king pondered with
troubled spirit:
You are worried when you hear that she is born;
Picking husbands makes you anxious and forlorn;
When she marries, will her husband be a churl?
It is tough to be the father of a girl.
