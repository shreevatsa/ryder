248              THE PANCHATANTRA
To a second inquirer he gave the same reply. Then
on all who questioned him, he bestowed his stereo-
typed answer. This is how he came by his nickname
of Mister Duly.
Now a princess named Moonlight, who was in the
first flush of youth and beauty, stood one day with a
girl friend, looking out over the city. At that spot a
prince, extraordinarily handsome and charming,
chanced to come—it was fate's doing—within her
range of vision. The moment she saw him, she was
smitten by the arrows of Love, and said to her friend:
"Dear girl, you must make an effort to bring us to-
gether this very day."
So the friend went straight to him and said:
"Moonlight sent me to you. She sends you this mes-
sage: 'The sight of you has reduced me to the last
extremity of love. If you do not hasten to me, I shall
die, nothing less/ "
On hearing this, he said: "If I cannot avoid the
trip, please tell me how to get into the house." And
the friend said: "When night comes, you must climb
up a stout strap that will be hanging from an upper
story of the palace." And he replied: "If you have it
all settled, I will do my part." With this understand-
ing the girl returned to Moonlight.
But when night came, the prince thought it over:
"A Brahman-slayer, so they say,
Is he who tries to house
With teacher's child, or wife of friend,
Or royal servant's spouse.
