"How was that?" asked Slow. And Spot told the
story of
THE MICE THAT SET ELEPHANTS FREE
There was once a region where people, houses, and
temples had fallen into decay. So the mice, who were
old settlers there, occupied the chinks in the floors
of stately dwellings with sons, grandsons (both in the
male and female line), and further descendants as
they were born, until their holes formed a dense
tangle. They found uncommon happiness in a variety
of festivals, dramatic performances (with plots of
their own invention), wedding-feasts, eating-parties,
drinking-bouts, and similar diversions. And so the
time passed.
But into this scene burst an elephant-king, whose
retinue numbered thousands. He, with his herd, had
started for the lake upon information that there was
water there. As he marched through the mouse com-
munity, he crushed faces, eyes, heads, and necks of
such mice as he encountered.
Then the survivors held a convention. "We are
being killed," they said, "by these lumbering ele-
phants—curse them! If they come this way again,
there will not be mice enough for seed. Besides:
An elephant will kill you, if
He touch; a serpent if he sniff;
King's laughter has a deadly sting;
A rascal kills by honoring.
