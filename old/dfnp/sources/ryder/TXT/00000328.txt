CROWS AND OWLS                 323
All spoken words, if harsh and heedless
And inappropriate and needless,
Are self-condemnatory slips
That turn to poison on the lips.
And again:
However wise and strong you be,
Beware the needless enemy:
You would not swallow poison down
Because a doctor lives in town.
No man of sense vituperates
Another, while the public waits;
For even truth should be concealed,
If causing sorrow when revealed.
And finally:
Reflect with many a chosen friend;
Reflect alone, and to the end;
Then act. You are intelligent,
And fame's and wealth's recipient."
After these reflections, the crow also left the spot.
"For this cause, my son, we have an inherited
feud with the crows."
"Father," said Cloudy, "what should we do under
the circumstances?" And Live-Strong answered:
"Even in these circumstances there is an effective
procedure other than the six expedients. This I will
adopt, and will myself lead the way to conquer the
enemy. I will deceive them and put them in a fatal
situation. For the saying goes:
The strong, deft, clever rascals note,
Who robbed the Brahman of his goat."
