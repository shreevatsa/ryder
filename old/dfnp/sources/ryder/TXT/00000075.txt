66               THE PANCHATANTRA
When youVe hooked another's lover,
Best enjoy the fruit of youth.
And once again:
Fate may rob him of his manhood,
He may handsome be or ugly,
Yet a wench, whate'er it cost her,
Entertains her lover snugly."
"Very fine indeed," said the weaver's wife. "But
tell me how I am to go when I am tied fast. And here
lies my husband—the brute!" "My dear," said the
barber's wife, "he is helpless with drink and will not
wake until the sun's rays reach him. I will set you
free and take your place myself. But you must hurry
back when you have entertained your admirer."
This she did, and a moment later the weaver rose
a little mollified, and said drunkenly: "Come, you
nagger! If you will stay at home after today and stop
nagging, I will set you free." The barber's wife said
nothing, fearing that her voice would betray her.
Even when he repeated his offer, she made no answer.
Then he became angry and cut off her nose with a
sharp knife. And he said: "Whore! Now you can
stay there. I shall not be nice to you again." So he
fell asleep, muttering. Now Godly, having lost his
money, was so tormented by hunger that he could
not sleep, and was a witness of all that the women did.
Presently the weaver's wife, after enjoying the
full delight of love with her swain, came home and
said to the barber's wife: "Well, are you all right?
I hope that brute did not get up while I was gone."
