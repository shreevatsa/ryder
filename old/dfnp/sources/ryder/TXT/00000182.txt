THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            175
Now in the absence of the counselor, a naked
monk arrived in the city at the end of the hot season*
He was master of the astronomical specialties, such as
problems and etymologies, rising of the zodiacal signs,
augury, ecliptic intersection, and the decanate; also
stellar mansions divided into nine parts, twelve parts,
thirty parts; the shadow of the gnomon, eclipses, and
numerous other mysteries. With these the fellow in
a few days won the entire population, as if he had
bought and paid for them.
Finally, as the matter went from mouth to mouth,
the king heard a report of its character, and had the
curiosity to summon the monk to his palace. There
he offered him a seat and asked: "Is it true, Professor,
as they say, that you read the thoughts of others?"
"That will be demonstrated in the sequel," replied the
monk, and by discourses adapted to the occasion he
brought the poor king to the extreme pitch of curi-
osity.
One day he failed to appear at the regular hour,
but the following day, on entering the palace, he an-
nounced: "O King, I bring you the best of good tid-
ings. At dawn today I flung this body aside within
my cell, assumed a body fit for the world of the gods,
and, inspired with the knowledge that all the im-
mortals thought of me with longing, I went to heaven
and have just returned. While there, I was requested
by the gods to inquire in their name after the king's
welfare."
