where they stood, then swarmed up the branches,
and by cutting the ropes aloft, set their friends

Make friends, make friends, however strong, ....
and the rest of it."
When Slow had listened to this, he said: "Be it

you are at home. Pray dismiss anxieties and behave
as in your own dwelling." So they all took food and
recreation at such hours as suited each, met at the
noon hour in the shade of crowding trees beside the

religion, economics, and similar subjects. And this

And science will suffice:
The time of dunderheads is spent
In squabbling, sleep, and vice.
