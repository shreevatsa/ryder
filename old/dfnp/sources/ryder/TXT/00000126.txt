THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            117
performance of numerous sacrifices, concentrated au-
thority by heedful attention to all phases of royal
duty, and lived happily.
"And that is why I say:
What tiger, monkey, snake advised, ....
and the rest of it." And Victor continued:
"Friend or kinsman, teacher, king,
Must be kept from trespassing:
If they cling to evil still,
They will bend you to their will.
"O King, he is obviously a traitor. However,
Tirelessly benevolent,
Save a friend on evil bent:
This is sainthood's perfect song;
Every substitute is wrong.
Again:
Who saves from vice is truly kind;
True wife is she who shares your mind;
True acts are free from every blame;
True joy, from avarice's shame;
True wisdom wins the praise of saints;
True friends involve in no restraints;
True glory knows no haughtiness;
True men are cheerful in distress.
And again:
Rest your sleeping head in fire;
Pillow it with snakes:
Do not smile at worthy friends
Who pursue mistakes.
