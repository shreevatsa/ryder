you must make these princes incomparable masters of
the art of practical life. In return, I will bestow upon
you a hundred land-grants."
And Vishnusharman made answer to the king:
"O King, listen. Here is the plain truth. I am not the
man to sell good learning for a hundred land-grants.
But if I do not, in six months' time, make the boys
acquainted with the art of intelligent living, I will
give up my own name. Let us cut the matter short.
Listen to my lion-roar. My boasting arises from no
greed for cash. Besides, I have no use for money; I
am eighty years old, and all the objects of sensual
desire have lost their charm. But in order that your
request may be granted, I will show a sporting spirit
in reference to artistic matters. Make a note of the
date. If I fail to render your sons, in six months'
time, incomparable masters of the art of intelligent
living, then His Majesty is at liberty to show me His
Majestic bare bottom."
When the king, surrounded by his counselors, had
listened to the Brahman's highly unconventional
promise, he was penetrated with wonder, intrusted
the princes to him, and experienced supreme content.
Meanwhile, Vishnusharman took the boys, went
home, and made them learn by heart five books
which he composed and called: (I) "The Loss of
Friends," (II) "The Winning of Friends," (III)
"Crows and Owls," (IV) "Loss of Gains," (V) "Ill-
considered Action."
