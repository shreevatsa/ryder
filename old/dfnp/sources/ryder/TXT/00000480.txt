ILL-CONSIDERED ACTION          467
She dooms him to a speedy death
Without a shade of doubt.
"Therefore, O King, shun the sight of her. Give
her to anyone who will marry her, but banish him
from the country. If this is done, there is no offense
to laws human or divine."
When the king had listened to this opinion, he
ordered a proclamation to be made everywhere with
beat of drum, as follows: "Hear ye! There is a three-
breasted princess. To anyone who marries her the
king will give a hundred thousand gold-pieces, but
will exile him." For a long time this proclamation
was made without anyone marrying the princess, who
remained in seclusion and grew to young womanhood.
Now there was a blind man in the city, and as
companion he had a hunchback named Slow, who
guided him with a staff. These two heard the drum
and consulted, saying: "In case we touch that drum,
we get girl and gold. With the gold our life will be
happy. And even if death results from the girl's de-
formity, it will put a final end to the wretchedness of
poverty. For
Until a mortal's belly-pot
Is full, he does not care a jot
For love or music, wit or shame,
For body's care or scholar's name,
For virtue or for social charm,
For lightness or release from harm,
For godlike wisdom, youthful beauty.
For purity or anxious duty."
