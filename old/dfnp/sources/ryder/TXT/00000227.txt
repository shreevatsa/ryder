220             THE PANCHATANTRA
Why speak of virtue here or moral harm?
What stance could help or mar?
Tis Time that stretches forth a fatal arm,
And seizes from afar."
When Gay-neck had spoken thus, Gold began to
cut his bonds, but Gay-Neck checked him, saying:
"My good friend, this is wrong. Please do not cut my
bonds first, but my followers'." Now Gold grew
angry at this and said: "Come now! You are mis-
taken. For servants follow the master." "No, no, my
good friend," said Gay-Neck. "All these poor crea-
tures left others to take service with me. Shall I fail
to show them this petty honor? You know the
proverb:
The king who offers honor to
His followers beyond their due,
Has servants glad who never quail,
Not even should his money fail.
And again:
Through trust, the root of happy power,
A creature wins to kingship's flower;
While lions, born to kingship, must
As tyrants govern, lacking trust.
"Besides, after cutting my bonds, you might per-
haps get a toothache. Or that villainous hunter might
return. In that case, I should surely plunge to hell.
As the proverb says:
A king who is content to know
That loyal servants suffer woe,
Will later go to hell, but first
Will see his earthly projects burst."
