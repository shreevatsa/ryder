THE WINNING OF FRIENDS        233

cell. So that you seem to dwell here, but in reality
you have earned a place in hell. For the proverb says:

A certain course for hell to steer,
Become a chaplain for a year;
Or try more expeditious ways—
Become an abbot for three days.

Poor fool! You take pride in what should cause con-

trition."

When he heard this, Crop-Ear was terrified and
said: "Do not speak thus, holy sir. There is no friend
nearer my heart than you. Pray hear the reason of
my inattention. There is a villainous mouse that
jumps and climbs to my alms-bowl, however high I
hang it, and he eats my leavings. Thus the servants
get no recompense, and refuse to tidy up. So to
frighten the mouse, I strike the alms-bowl repeatedly
with my bamboo. This is the whole story. But I
should add that the villain has such cleverness in
jumping as to put cats, monkeys, and other creatures
to the blush."
Then Wide-Bottom said: "But have you found
the mouse-hole anywhere?" "Holy sir," said Crop-
Ear, "I have not." "Surely," said the other, "his hole
is over his hoard. Beyond question, the fragrance
from his hoard makes him spry. For
The smell of wealth is quite enough
To wake a creature's sterner stuff;
And wealth's enjoyment, even more,
With virtuous giving from his store.
