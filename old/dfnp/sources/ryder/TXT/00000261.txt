254             THE PANCHATANTRA

No poor man's evidence is heard,

Though logic link it word to word:

While wealthy babble passes muster

Though crammed with harshness, vice, and bluster.

The wealthy, though of meanest birth,
Are much respected on the earth:
The poor whose lineage is prized
Like clearest moonlight, are despised.

The wealthy are, however old,
Rejuvenated by their gold:
If money has departed, then
The youngest lads are aged men.

Since brother, son, and wife, and friend
Desert when cash is at an end,
Returning when the cash rolls in,
cash that is our next of kin.

"At the moment when, with such thoughts in my
mind, I went to my quarters, our friend Swift came
to me and suggested a journey hither. So here I am.
I have come with him to visit you. Thus I have
related to you the cause of my gloom.
"Well, there is this to be said:
The world — gods, elephants, and men,
Deer, devils, snakes —
Before the noonday hour is spent,
Its dinner takes.
When hour and appetite arrive,
There should suffice
For world-wide conqueror or slave
A bowl of rice.
