298             THE PANCHATANTRA
When rams draw back, their butting fiercer stings;
The crouching king of beasts more deadly springs:
So wise dissemblers, holding vengeance sure,
In dumb communion with their hearts, endure.
And once again:
A king, abandoning his realm
To foes of fighting worth,
Preserves his life, as Fight-Firm did,
And later rules the earth.
And so, to sum it up:
The weak who, struggling with the strong,
Are not too proud to fight,
Bring great rejoicing to their foes,
And on their kinsmen, blight.
"Therefore, since you are engaged with a powerful
foe, there is occasion for a change of base. It is no
time for peace or war/'
When he had listened to this view, the king said
to Live-On: "My worthy sir, pray express your opin-
ion also." And Live-On said: "O King, I disapprove
of peace, war, and change of base, all three of them;
and particularly change of base. For
A crocodile at home
Can beat an elephant;
But if he goes abroad,
A dog can make him pant.
And again:
When stronger foes attack,
Close in your fortress stay;
But sally to relieve
Your friends, and save the day.
