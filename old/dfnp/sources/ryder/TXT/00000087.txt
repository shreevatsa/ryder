78               THE PANCHATANTRA
that they said:  "Uncle! Friend! Unselfish kinsman!
Take me first! Me first! Did you never hear this?
Stout hearts delight to pay the price
Of merciful self-sacrifice,
Count life as nothing, if it end
In gentle service to a friend."
Then the old rascal laughed in his heart, and took
counsel with his mind, thus: "My shrewdness has
brought these fishes into my power. They ought to be
eaten very comfortably." Having thus thought it
through, he promised what the thronging fish im-
plored, lifted some in his bill, carried them a certain
distance to a slab of stone, and ate them there. Day
after day he made the trip with supreme delight and
satisfaction, and meeting the fish, kept their con-
fidence by ever new inventions.
One day the crab, disturbed by the fear of death,
importuned him with the words: "Uncle, pray save
me, too, from the jaws of death." And the heron re-
flected: "I am quite tired of this unvarying fish diet.
I should like to taste him. He is different, and choice."
So he picked up the crab and flew through the air.
But since he avoided all bodies of water and
seemed planning to alight on the sun-scorched rock,
the crab asked him: "Uncle, where is that pond with-
out any bottom?" And the heron laughed and said:
"Do you see that broad, sun-scorched rock? All the
water-dwellers have found repose there. Your turn
has now come to find repose."
