near, bowed low, and stood before him. But when the
lion saw that he was tardy and too small at that for
a meal, his soul flamed with wrath, and he taunted
the rabbit, saying: "You reprobate! First, you are
too small for a meal. Second, you are tardy. Because
of this wickedness I am going to kill you, and tomor-
row morning I shall extirpate every species of ani-
mal."
Then the rabbit bowed low and said with defer-
ence: "Master, the wickedness is not mine, nor the
other animals*. Pray hear the cause of it." And the
lion answered: "Well, tell it quick, before you are
between my fangs."
"Master," said the rabbit, "all the animals recog-
nized today that the rabbits' turn had come, and be-
cause I was quite small, they dispatched me with five
other rabbits. But in mid-journey there issued from
a great hole in the ground a lion who said: 'Where are
you bound? Pray to your favorite god/ Then I said:
'We are traveling as the dinner of lion Numskull,
our master, according to agreement/ 'Is that so ?' said
he. 'This forest belongs to me. So all the animals,
without exception, must deal with me—according to
agreement. This Numskull is a sneak thief. Call him
out and bring him here at once. Then whichever of
us proves stronger, shall be king and shall eat all
these animals/ At his command, master, I have come
to you. This is the cause of my tardiness. For the
rest, my master is the sole judge."
