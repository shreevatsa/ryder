shall starve to death." "But," said Gold, "how can I
make friends with you, with an enemy? For the prov-
erb says:
Make no truce, however snug,
With foemen dire:
Water, even boiling hot,
Will quench a fire."
"Why," said the crow, "you do not even know me
by sight. Why should there be strife? Why say a
thing so little to the purpose?"
"Sir," said Gold, "strife is of two kinds, natural
and incidental. Now you are in natural strife with
me. And the saying goes:
By incidental means one ends
An incidental strife,
And quickly. Nature's kind endures
Until the loss of life."
"Sir," said the crow, "I should like to learn the
characteristic quality of each kind." "Well," said the
mouse, "incidental strife springs from a specific cause,
and can therefore be removed by rendering an ap-
propriate service. But strife rooted in nature never
disappears. Thus there is enduring strife between
mungoose and snake—herbivorous creatures and
those armed with claws—water and fire—gods and
devils—dogs and cats—rival wives—lions and ele-
phants—hunter and deer—crow and owl—scholar
and numskull—wife and harlot—saint and sinner.
In these cases, nobody belonging to anybody has been
killed by anybody, yet they fight to the death."
