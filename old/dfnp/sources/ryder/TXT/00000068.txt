THE LOSS OF FRIENDS              59
mountain torrent. The days of our life are like a fire
in chaff. Delights of the flesh are as the shadow of a
cloud. Union with son, friend, servant, wife, is but a
dream. All this I discern clearly. What shall I do
that I may safely cross the sea of many lives?"
On hearing this, Godly said respectfully: "My
son, blest are you, being thus indifferent to the world
in early youth. What says the proverb?
'Tis only saints in youth
That can be saints in truth:
Ah, who is not a saint
When ebbing passions faint?
And again:
First mind, then body ages
In case of holy sages:
The body ages first,
Mind never, in the worst.
"And as for your search to find a means of safely
crossing the sea of many lives, just listen to this:
A hangman with his matted hair,
Or serf, or other man, through prayer
To holy Shiva, changes caste,
Becomes pure Brahman at the last.
Six syllables, a little prayer;
A single blossom resting there
On Shiva's symbol—and on earth
No further pain, no later birth,"
When he had listened to this, June clasped the
holy man's feet and said deferentially: "This being
so, holy sir, pray do me the favor of imposing a vow."
