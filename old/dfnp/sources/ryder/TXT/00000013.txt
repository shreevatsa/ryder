4               THE PANCHATANTRA
B.C. At this date, however, many of the individual
stories were already ancient. He then enumerates no
less than twenty-five recensions of the work in India.
The text here translated is late, dating from the year
1199 A.D.
It is not here intended to summarize the history
of these stories in India, nor their travels through the
Near East and through Europe. The story is attrac-
tive—whose interest is not awakened by learning, for
example, that in this work he makes the acquaintance
of one of La Fontaine's important sources? Yet here,
as elsewhere, the work of the "scholars" has been of
somewhat doubtful value, diverting attention from
the primary to the secondary, from literature itself
to facts, more or less important, about literature. The
present version has not been made by a scholar, but
by the opposite of a scholar, a lover of good books,
eager, so far as his powers permit, to extend an ac-
curate and joyful acquaintance with the world's
masterpieces. He will therefore not endeavor to tell
the history of the Panchatantra, but to tell what the
Panchatantra is.

Whoever learns the work by heart,
Or through the story-teller's art
Becomes acquainted,
His life by sad defeat—although
The king of heaven be his foe—
Is never tainted.
