16               THE PANCHATANTRA
These the princes learned, and in six months' time
they answered the prescription. Since that day this
work on the art of intelligent living, called Pan-
chatantra, or the "Five Books," has traveled the
world, aiming at the awakening of intelligence in the
young. To sum the matter up:
Whoever learns the work by heart,
Or through the story-teller's art
Becomes acquainted,
His life by sad defeat—although
The king of heaven be his foe—'
Is never tainted.
