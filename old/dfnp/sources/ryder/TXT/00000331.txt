326             THE PANCHATANTRA
So the Brahman concluded that it was a goblin in
quadruped form, threw it on the ground, and made

"And that is why I say:
The strong, deft, clever rascals note, ....
and the rest of it.
"Moreover, there is sound sense in this:
Is any man uncheated by
New servants' diligence,
The praise of guests, the maiden's tears,
And roguish eloquence?

For all his quivering."

snake, and his name was Haughty. One day, instead

opening was small, and fate willed it so.
