Then another bird said: "It is plain that we are
not equal to a contest with mighty ocean. So I will
tell you what is now timely. There is an old gander
who lives beside a banyan tree, who will give us sound
and practical advice. Let us go and ask him. For
there is a saying:
Take old folks' counsel (those are old
Who have experience)
The captive wild-goose flock was freed
By one old gander's sense."
"How was that?" asked the birds. And the speak-

THE SHREWD OLD GANDER
In a part of a forest was a fig tree with massive
branches. In it lived a flock of wild geese. At the root
of this tree appeared a creeping vine of the species
called koshambi. Thereupon the old gander said:
"This vine that is climbing our fig tree bodes ill to us.
By means of it, someone might perhaps climb up here
some day and kill us. Take it away while it is still
slender and readily cut." But the geese despised his
counsel and did not cut the vine, so that in course of
time it wound its way up the tree.
Now one day when the geese were out foraging, a
hunter climbed the fig tree by following the spiral
vine, laid a snare among the nests, and went home.
