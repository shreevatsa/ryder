394             THE PANCHATANTRA
return. But after a long time Handsome said to a
lizard that lived in another hole in the same well:
"My dear madam, do me a small favor, since Theo-
dore is an old friend of yours. Please go and find him
in some pool or other, and take him a message from
me. Tell him to return quickly, alone if need be, if
no other frogs will come. I cannot live here without
him. And tell him that if I hurt him, he may have
all the merit I have acquired in a lifetime."
So the lizard did as she was bid, quickly hunted
Theodore out, and said: "My dear sir, your friend
Handsome is waiting, waiting for your return. Please
hurry back. And furthermore, in case of his doing
you any harm, he pledges you the merit acquired in a
lifetime. So drop all anxious thoughts, and come
home." But Theodore said:
The hungry man at nothing sticks;
The poor man has his heartless tricks.
Tell Handsome, miss, that Theodore
Will see him in the well no more.
And so he sent her back.
"So then, you rascally water-beast! Like Theo-
dore, I will never, never enter your house."
When he heard this, the crocodile said: "My good
friend, you are quite wrong. I beg of you to come to
my house, and so wipe out my sin of ingratitude.
Otherwise, I shall starve myself to death on your
doorstep."
