LOSS OF GAINS                    423
Yes, the proverb is right:
Shun pleasant days that listless pass,
The joy that hides
In slotn. For deer can eat the grass
That fate provides.
Here ends Book IV, called "Loss of Gains/' The
first verse runs:
Blind folly always has to pay
For giving property away
Because of blandishments and guile—
The monkey tricked the crocodile.
