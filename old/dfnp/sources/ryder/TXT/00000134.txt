he is treacherous? And what is his fighting tech-
nique?" And Victor answered: "Formerly he would
come into the presence of my lord and king with limbs
relaxed. If today he approaches timidly, in obvious
readiness to thrust with his horns, then the king may
understand that he has treachery in mind."
Hereupon Victor rose and visited Lively. To him,
also, he showed himself sluggish, like one penetrated
by discouragement. Therefore Lively said: "My
good fellow, are you in spirits?" To which he replied:
"How can a dependent be in spirits? For you know
They see their wealth in others' power
Who wait upon a king;
They even fear to lose their lives:
A doleful song they sing.
Again:
With birth begin the sorrows which
Forever after cling,
The never ending train of woes
In service of a king.
Five deaths-in-life sage Vyasa notes
With well-known epic swing:
The poor man, sick man, exile, fool,
And servant of a king.
His food repels; he dare not say
An independent thing;
Though sleepless, he is not awake
Who hangs upon a king.
