THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            103
moment the weaver, mounted on Garuda, and scat-
tering largess of gold and precious gems, flew from the
palace roof toward heaven's vault, while the towns-
people, thrilling with wonder, gazed and adored, then
beyond the city he hovered above his army, and drew
from Vishnu's conch a proud, grand burst of martial
sound.
At the blare of the conch, elephants, horses,
chariots, foot-soldiers, were dismayed and many gar-
ments were fouled. Some with shrill screams fled afar.
Some rolled on the ground, all purposive movement
paralyzed. Some stood stock still, with terrified gaze
fixed unwavering on heaven.
At this point all the gods were drawn to the
spot by curiosity to see the fight, and Indra said to
Brahma: "Brahma, is this some imp or demon who
must needs be slain ? For blessed Vishnu, mounted on
Garuda, has gone forth to battle in person." At these
words Brahma pondered:
"Lord Vishnu's discus drinks in flood
The hostile demons' gushing blood,
And strikes no mortal flat:
The jungle lion who can draw
The tusker's life with awful paw,
Disdains to crush a gnat.
What means this marvel ?" Thus Brahma himself was
astonished. That is why I told you:
Not even Brahma sees the end
Of well-devised deceit:
The weaver, taking Vishnu's form,
Embraced the princess sweet.
