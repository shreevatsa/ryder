THE WINNING OF FRIENDS        049
And again:
A deed that brings dishonor,
Whereby a man must fall,
That causes disadvantage,
Don't do it—that is all."
So after full reflection he did not go to her. But
Mister Duly was roaming through the night and spied
a strap hanging down the wall of a fine stucco house.
Out of curiosity mingled with bravado he took hold
and climbed.
Now the princess, being perfectly confident that
he was the right man, treated him with high con-
sideration, giving him a bath, a meal, a drink, fine
garments, and the like. Then she went to bed with
him, and her limbs thrilled with joy at touching him.
But she said: "I fell in love with you at first sight,
and have given you my person. I shall never have
another husband, even mentally. Why don't you
realize this and talk to me?" And he replied:
"What's duly his, a man receives."
When she heard this, her heart stopped beating,
and she sent him down the strap in a hurry. So he
made for a tumble-down temple and went to sleep.
Presently a policeman who had an appointment with
a woman of easy virtue arrived there and found him
asleep. As the policeman wished to hush the matter
up, he said: "Who are you?" and the other answered:
"What's duly his, a man receives."
