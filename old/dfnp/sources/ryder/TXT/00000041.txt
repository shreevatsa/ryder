32               THE PANCHATANTRA
One who flatters when addressed,
Does the proper things.
Acts without expressing doubts.
Is beloved of kings.
One, the royal gifts of cash
Prudently who flings,
Wearing gifts of garments, he
Is beloved of kings.
One who never makes reply
That his master stings,
Never boisterously laughs,
Is beloved of kings.
One who never hearkens to
Queenly whisperings,
In the women's quarters dumb,
Is beloved of kings.
One who, even in distress,
Never boasts and sings
Of his master's favor, he
Is beloved of kings.
One who hates his master's foe,
Loves his friend, and brings
Pain or joy to either one,
Is beloved of kings.
One who never disagrees,
Blames, or pulls the strings
Of intrigue with enemies,
Is beloved of kings.
