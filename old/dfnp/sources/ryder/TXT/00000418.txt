LOSS OF GAINS                   403
the jackal-cub said: "Brothers, that is an elephant,
an enemy of your race. Don't go near him." With
this he ran home. And the other two, seeing their
elder brother routed, felt their pluck ooze away. The
well-known proverb is right:
One bold and plucky fighter
Will give an army pluck:
One broken, routed blighter
Diffuses evil luck.
And, indeed,
This is the very reason why
Kings look for sturdy fighters,
Heroic, dauntless, stone-wall men,
And shun the cowardly blighters.
Later the twin brothers went home, and humor-
ously told their parents how their elder brother had
behaved. "Why, you know," said they, "the minute
he saw him, he couldn't get far enough quick enough."
When the jackal heard this, wrath entered his
spirit. His blossom-lip quivered, his eyes grew red,
and a frown made two deep wrinkles on his brow.
And he spoke harshly, scolding the twins.
Then the lioness took him aside and admonished
him: "You must never, never speak so, my dear.
They are your brothers." But her patient pleading
filled him with greater anger, and he burst upon her,
too: "Do you think me their inferior in courage or
beauty or science or application or skill ? What right
have they to ridicule me? I am certainly going to
kill them."
