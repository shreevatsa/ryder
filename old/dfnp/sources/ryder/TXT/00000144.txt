THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             135
whose name was Ugly, was overburdened and fell
limp, with every limb relaxed. Then the merchant
divided the pack of cloth, loaded it on other camels,
and because he found himself in a wild forest region
where delay was impossible, he proceeded, leaving
Ugly behind.
When the trader was gone, Ugly hobbled about
and began to crop the grass. Thus in a very few days
the poor fellow regained his strength.
In that forest lived a lion whose name was
Haughty, who had as hangers-on a leopard, a crow,
and a jackal. As they roamed the forest, they en-
countered the abandoned camel, and the lion said,
after observing his fantastic and comical shape:
"This is an exotic in our forest. Ask him what he is."
So the crow informed himself of the facts and said:
"This is what goes by the name of camel in the
world." Thereupon the lion asked him: "My good
friend, where did you come from?" And the camel
gave precise details of his separation from the trader,
so that the lion experienced compassion and guar-
anteed his personal security.
In this posture of affairs, the lion fought an ele-
phant one day, received a thrust from a tusk, and
had to keep his cave. And when five or six days had
passed, they all found themselves in urgent distress
from the failure of food. So the lion, observing how
they drooped, said to them: "I am crippled by this
wound and cannot supply you with the usual food.
