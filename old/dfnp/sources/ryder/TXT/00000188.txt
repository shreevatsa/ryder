the snake, with the permission of her companions,
and at once began devoted attendance upon him by
offering milk to drink and performing other services.

and entered her bed. "Who is this?" she cried. "He
has the form of a man." And thinking him a strange
man, she started up, trembling in every limb, un-
locked the door, and was about to dart away when
she heard him say: "Stay, my dear wife. I am your
husband." Then, in order to convince her, he re-
entered the body which he had left behind in the
chest, issued from it again, and came to her.
When she beheld him flashing with lofty diadem,
with earrings, bracelets, armbands, and rings, she fell
at his feet, and then they sank into a glad embrace.
Now his father, the Brahman, rose betimes and
discovered how matters stood. He therefore seized the
serpent's skin that lay in the chest, and consumed it
with fire, for he thought: "I do not want him to enter
that again." And in the morning he and his wife, with
the greatest possible joy, introduced to everybody as
their own an extraordinarily handsome son, quite
wrapped up in his love affair.
After Strong had related this parallel case to the
king, he set fire to the cell that contained the naked
monk.
