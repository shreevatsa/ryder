to sleep. Thereupon that dreadful holy man awoke
and struck me on the head with the frazzled bamboo.
Yet somehow I escaped death—predestination, you
see. As the old rhyme puts it:
What's duly his, a man receives;
This law not even God can break;
My heart is not surprised, nor grieves;
For what is mine, no strangers take.
"How was that?" asked the crow and the turtle.
And Gold told the story of
MISTER DULY
In a certain city lived a merchant named Ocean.
His son picked up a book at a sale for a hundred
rupees. In this book was the line:
What's duly his, a man receives.
Now Ocean saw it and asked his son: "My boy,
what did you give for this book?" "A hundred
rupees," said the son. "Simpleton!" said Ocean, "if
you pay a hundred rupees for a book with one line of
poetry written in it, how do you calculate to make
money? From this day you are not at home in my
house." After this wigging, he showed him the door.
This melancholy rebuff drove the young man to
another country far away, where he came to a city
and stopped there. After some days a native asked
him: "Whence are you, sir? What might your name
be?" And he replied:
"What's duly his, a man receives."
