THE LOSS OF FRIENDS            191
"Besides, who can trust a creature, whether
human or not, that has two tongues in a single mouth?
As the proverb says:
Mouths of snake and scamp
Bear a savage stamp;
Rough and ruthless still,
Only good for ill:
Where the tongue is double,
You may look for trouble.
"Consequently, your conduct makes me fearful for
my own person. For
I would not trust a rascal;
His ways I understand:
The petted, pampered serpent
Will bite the feeding hand.
Again:
A fire will burn, though kindled
In fragrant sandalwood:
A rascal is a rascal,
Although his birth is good.
"After all, this is the very nature of rascals. As
the proverb says:
Each self-advertising traitor,
Skilful as calumniator,
Fate condemns to ruin all
Who within his clutches fall.
Oh, any tongue in human mouth
That lends itself to slander's cant
Yet does not split a hundred times,
Is surely made of adamant.
