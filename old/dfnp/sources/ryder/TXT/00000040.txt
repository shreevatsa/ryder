THE LOSS OF FRIENDS             31
And finally:
The brave, the learn&d, he who wins
To bureaucratic power—
These three, alone of all mankind,
Can pluck earth's golden flower.
"Now let me inform you how power is gained by
dancing attendance on a master.
Win the friendly counselors,
To the monarch dear,
Win persuasive speakers; so
Gain the royal ear.
On the undiscerning mob
'Tis not wise to toil:
No man reaps a harvest by
Plowing barren soil.
Serve a king of merit, though
Friendless, destitute;
After some delay, you pluck
Long-enduring fruit.
Hate your master, and you fill
Servant's meanest state:
Not discerning whom to serve,
'Tis yourself you hate.
Treat the dowager, the queen,
And the king-to-be,
Chaplain, porter, counselor,
Most obsequiously.
One who seeks the van in fights.
In the palace clings,
In the city walks behind,
Is beloved of kings.
