the pond, dragging the heron's neck as if it had been
a lotus-stalk. And when he came among the fish, they
said: "Brother, why come back?" Thereupon he
showed the head as his credentials and said: "He
enticed the water-dwellers from every quarter, de-
ceived them with his prevarications, dropped them
on a slab of rock not far away, and ate them. But
I—further life being predestined—perceived that he
destroyed the trustful, and I have brought back his
neck. Forget your worries. All the water-dwellers
shall live in peace."
"And that is why I say:
A heron ate what fish he could, . . •.
and the rest of it."
"My friend," said the crow, "tell me how this
villainous snake is to meet his doom." And the jackal
answered: "Go to some spot frequented by a great
monarch. There seize a golden chain or a necklace
from some wealthy man who guards it carelessly. De-
posit this in such a place that when it is recovered, the
snake may be killed."
So the crow and his wife straightway flew off at
random, and the wife came upon a certain pond. As
she looked about, she saw the women of a king's court
playing in the water, and on the bank they had laid
golden chains, pearl necklaces, garments, and gems.
One chain of gold the crow-hen seized and started for
the tree where she lived.
