And again:
His actions may be hard to bear,
His speech be harsh to hear;
The heart still clings delighted to
A person truly dear."
"For that very reason," retorted Victor, "there is
a serious flaw in the business of getting on in the
world. Observe how this person, upon whom the
master has concentrated his consideration to the ex-
clusion of the whole company of animals, now desires
to become himself the master. As the verse puts it:
The man of birth or man unknown,
If kingly eyes on him alone
Are fixed, aspires to seize the throne.
Therefore, dear though he be, he should be aban-
doned, being a traitor, like one who has never been
dear. There is much wisdom in the saying:
Pursue your aim, abandoning
The fools inclined to sin,
The comrades, brothers, friends, or sons,
Or honorable kin:
You know the song the women sing,
We hear it far and near—
What good are golden earrings, if
They lacerate your ear?
"And if you fancy that he will bring benefit be-
cause he is bulky of body, you make a perverse mis-
take. For
How use a proud bull-elephant
That will not serve the king?
A man is better, fat or lean,
Who does the helpful thing.
