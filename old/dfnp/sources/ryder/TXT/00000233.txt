aa6             THE PANCHATANTRA
"True friendship, sir, is an affair
Of seven words, the wise declare;
I've forced you, then, to be a friend—
So hear my pleading to the end.
Now grant me your friendship. If you refuse, I shall
starve where I stand."
And Gold reflected: "He is not unintelligent. His
speech proves it.
None lacking shrewdness flatter well;
None but a lover plays the swell;
No saints are found in judgment seats;
No clear, straightforward speaker cheats.
So I must certainly grant him my friendship."
Having made up his mind to this, he said to the
crow: "My dear sir, you have won my confidence.
But it was necessary first to test your intelligence.
Now I lay my head in your lap." With this he started
to come forth, but when scarcely halfway out, he
stopped again. And Swift said: "Do you cherish even
yet some reason for mistrusting me? I see you do not
leave your fortress."
"I have no fear of you," said Gold, "for I have
examined your mind. But if I gave my confidence, I
might perhaps meet death through other friends of
yours." Then the crow spoke:
Friends purchased at the price of death
To other friends and true,
One should avoid, like worthless corn
Where finest rice-plants grew.
