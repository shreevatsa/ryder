a8               THE PANCHATANTRA
The jobless man is hired
For careful serving;
The holder may be fired,
If undeserving.
No character moves up or down
At others' smile or others' frown;
But honor or contempt on earth
Will follow conduct's inner worth.
And once more:
It costs an effort still
To carry stones uphill;
They tumble in a trice:
So virtue, and so vice."
"Well," said Cheek, "what do you wish to imply?"
And Victor answered: "You see, our master is
frightened, his servants are frightened, and he does
not know what to do." "How can you be sure of
that?" asked Cheek, and Victor said: "Isn't it plain?
An ox can understand, of course,
The spoken word; a driven horse
Or elephant, exerts his force;
But men of wisdom can infer
Unuttered thought from features' stir—
For wit rewards its worshiper.
And again:
From feature, gesture, gait,
From twitch, or word,
From change in eye or face
Is thought inferred.
