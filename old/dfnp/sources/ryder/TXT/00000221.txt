2i4             THE PANCHATANTRA
was already near the tree, approaching to trap birds.
He was hideous in person, flat of hand and foot, bare
to the calf of the leg, dreadfully ugly of complexion,
had bloodshot eyes, was accompanied by dogs, wore
his hair in a knot, carried snare and club in his hand—
why spin it out? He seemed a second god of destruc-
tion, noose in hand; the incarnation of evil; the heart
of unrighteousness; the teacher of every sin; the
bosom friend of death.
When Swift saw him, he was disturbed in spirit
and reflected: "What does he mean to do, the sinner?
To hurt me? Or has he some other purpose?" And
he clung to the hunter's heels, being filled with curi-
osity.
Now the hunter picked a spot, spread a snare,
scattered grain, and hid not far away. But the birds
who lived there were held in check by Swift's counsel,
regarded the rice-grains as deadly poison, and did not
peep.
At this juncture a dove-king named Gay-Neck,
with hundreds of dove retainers, was wandering in
search of food, and spied the rice-grains from afar.
In spite of dissuasion from Swift, he greedily sought
to eat them and alighted in the great snare. The mo-
ment he did so, he and his retainers were caught in the
meshes. Nor should he be blamed. It happened
through hostile fate. As the saying goes:
How did Ravan fail to feel
That 'tis wrong, a wife to steal?
