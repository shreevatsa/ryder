answer to his question, the other told the entire his-
tory of the wheel.
When the friend heard this, he scolded him, say-

Yet from lack of sense you did not do as I said. In-
deed, there is wisdom in the saying:
Scholarship is less than sense;
Therefore seek intelligence:
Senseless scholars in their pride
Made a lion; then they died."
"How was that?" asked the wheel-bearer. And
the gold-finder told the story of
THE LION-MAKERS
In a certain town were four Brahmans who lived
in friendship. Three of them had reached the far
shore of all scholarship,, but lacked sense. The other
found scholarship distasteful; he had nothing but
sense.
One day they met for consultation. "What is the
use of attainments," said they, "if one does not travel,
win the favor of kings, and acquire money? What-
ever we do, let us all travel."
But when they had gone a little way, the eldest
of them said: "One of us, the fourth, is a dullard, hav-
ing nothing but sense. Now nobody gains the favor-
able attention of kings by simple sense without schol-
arship. Therefore we will not share our earnings with
him. Let him turn back and go home."
