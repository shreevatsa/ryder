THE WINNING OF FRIENDS        243
With this broken-spirited lamentation I saw my
own hoard of wealth converted into a pillow for my
enemy, and at dawn I crept into my fortress—a
failure.
Then my attendants retired and gossiped to-
gether. "Look here!" said they, "the fellow has no
power to fill our bellies. Those who ride his back get
nothing but buffets—from cats, for example. Why
pay him reverence? For the proverb says:
A king from whom no bounties come,
But only buffets fall,
Had better be avoided, and
By soldiers first of all."
Such remarks I heard on the trail. And since,
when I returned to the fortress, not one of my fol-
lowers accompanied me (for I was penniless) I began
to ponder deeply.
"A curse, a curse on a life of poverty! There is
sound sense in the verse:
Even relatives are sure
Scornfully to treat the poor;
Pride is docked, and virtue's moon
Loses luster, waning soon;
Friends that were, disgusted fly;
Sorrows breed and multiply;
Comes the imputation then
Of the sins of other men.
When man is crushed by poverty
And stricken down by fate,
His best of friends become his foes,
And tried affection, hate.
