Hello,

I'm trying to typeset a few verses, and define an appropriate
environment/macro in (La)TeX so that one can simply write, for
example:

\begin{myverse}
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"
\end{myverse}

and have it typeset
(i) looking like two stanzas("verses"),
(ii) centered on the page (width-wise, I mean), and
(iii) with alternate lines indented, as above

LaTeX has a "verse" environment, but it requires \\ at the end of each
line, and one must specify indentation with something like
\hspace{2em} for each line that is to be indented.
Alternatively, there is the "alltt" environment, which respects
indentation and newlines, and inside which one can use \normalfont to
avoid the monospaced font, but everything is typeset flush left, the
same as the paragraphs. (Also, page breaks within a verse seem more
likely.)
With either of them, though, I don't know how to center the verses as
a whole (i.e., so that they are flush left in a box of width that of
the longest line in the verse, and the box is centered on the page).
Enclosing them in a "center" or "centering" environment centers each
line independently, which looks ugly.

There is also Peter Wilson's "verse" package, from whose excellent
documentation I learnt all the above, and which has some nice features
such as setting \indentpattern{01} to get alternate lines indented,
but it requires \\ at the end of each line as well, and requires each
stanza to be enclosed in a "patverse*" environment inside the verse
environment, which makes it all too verbose. Also, it seems to have an
ability to center the verses, but it requires the width of the longest
line to be manually set into \versewidth.

(I also tried something with \obeylines, but it's the equivalent of
inserting a \par token at the end of each line, so that was stupid of
me.)

So all things considered, the alltt environment seems the best option,
with something like:
\newenvironment{myverse}{\begin{alltt}\normalfont}{\end{alltt}}

Could someone help me figure out how to center its contents? (And to
decrease the likelihood of a page break?)

If centering is either impossible or not recommended, how can I
specify an indentation?

Thanks,

It is not clear what "center its contents" may mean in the context.
But it appears that appropriately positioned minipage with your verse
in it should to the job.

Hello,

I'm typesetting a document with frequent verse, something like the following:



[Line 1]
[Spaces][Line2]
[Line3]
[Spaces][Line4]

(Another stanza)

There's the "verse" environment, which requires setting \versewidth,
and \\ after every line. This is quite inconvenient; my preferred
solution at the moment is to enclose them in an `alltt` environment
with
