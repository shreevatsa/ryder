When --smart is on, ending a line with two hyphens and spaces does not cause a line break.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Type the following "This is a line--   \n like this."
2. Convert from markdown to HTML.
3. Notice that there is no <br/> after the first line.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The Markdown syntax (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p) says "When you do want to insert a <br /> break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return."

So expected:

    This is a line&mdash;<br/>
    like this.

Actual result:
    
    This is a line&mdash; like this.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
