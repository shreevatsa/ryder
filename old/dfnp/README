This is the esteemed translation of the Panchatantra, by Arthur
W. Ryder [Arthur William Ryder], 1877-1938.  He used Dr. Hertel's text
for the translation.  As the copyright law in India is "author's death
plus 60 years", this work passed into the public domain in India in
1998.  Copyright laws may be different in your country.  For example,
it is still under copyright in the United States, the original country
of publication.

There is also a near-complete scanned copy of the book on the
internet, e.g. on Scribd.[link] and archive.org [ http://www.archive.org/details/panchatantra035159mbp ]

It was originally scanned and (poorly) digitized at the University of
[Hyderabad?], and is available through the Digital Library of India
Project, at dli.iiit.ac.in

I have proofread, corrected, formatted and typeset this translation.

* In the plain text file, I have mostly retained the line-breaks of
the book, except that words broken by a hyphen have been joined on one
of the two lines in question, generally whichever keeps the larger of
the two lines shorter.

* I believe that I have caught most OCR errors, and any strange words
you might see were actually used by the author--such as
“unguipugnacious”, which, as far as I can tell, no one else in the
world has used, but this work uses it twice.  Still, if you find
errors, please do point them out.

* The writing mostly uses American spellings (honor, etc.), but it
also uses “wilful”, “fulfilment” and so on. Perhaps American English
gained the extra Ls later? Also, “self-depreciatory” is actually the
more correct.

* The following pages were missing and I had to retype them: 140, 141, 280, 281,
456, 457, 468, and 469. Pages 386-395 are in the book *twice*.
* The following pages had stuff in them: 77, 127, 128, 470

* I have introduced markup to keep stories together. In the HTML it
makes them collapsible. (TODO)

* The Sanskrit version used for the translation is mentioned once in
passing in the text ("Dr. Hertel, the learned and painstaking editor
of the text used by the present translator, believes that"). After
searching for it and downloading it (also from DLI), I found that the
translation is a very close one. The Sanskrit version was published by
Hertel in 1908, which is supposed to be a recension from 1199 AD known
to the Kashmiran commentator Purnabhadra. It is included facing the
translated text. The alignment (page and line breaks) are approximate.




-----

Typesetting the book in LaTeX is a bit hard, since we don't want chapter numbers, nor chapters on new pages.
(Solved with memoir class and appropriate chapterstyle.)

Need to scan pages 140 and 141; how did I miss them!
