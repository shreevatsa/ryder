  <h1 class="title">The Old Tiger and the Traveller</h1>

  <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

  <p>This is a translation by <a href=
  "http://web.mit.edu/vatsa/www/sanskrit/ryder/">Arthur W.
  Ryder</a> (published <a href=
  "http://books.google.com/books?id=WE0MAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA450">1908</a>)
  of the first (non-frame) story from the Hitopadesha. If you like
  this (and even if you don’t), you will like <a href="http://">his
  translation of the Panchantantra</a>.</p>

  <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

  <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

  <p>The Hitopadesha, like the Panchatantra, is a collection of
  emboxed stories, with interspersed verses—often quotations from
  famous sources—illustrating various morals that are not always
  followed by the characters. In a sense, the Hitopadesha is a
  “rewrite” of the Panchatantra, as it contains many of the same
  stories, but it streamlines the flow of the narrative and draws
  from many additional sources as well. It is written in fairly
  simple Sanskrit. The whole Sanskrit text is available <a href=
  "http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/4_narr/hitop_u.htm">
  at GRETIL</a>, and a word-for-word translation by Max Mueller is
  also <a href=
  "http://books.google.com/books?id=PLxfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17">available
  online</a> (<a href=
  "http://books.google.com/books?id=-DApAAAAYAAJ">v.2</a>).</p>

  <p>If you see below on the left the page images from a printed
  book, they are from the book <a href=
  "http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volume-v-40.html">“Friendly
  Advice” and “King Víkrama’s Adventures”</a> by Judit Törzsök,
  published as part of the <a href=
  "http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org">Clay Sanskrit Library</a>
  series. The images are from a <a href=
  "http://books.google.com/books?id=KdV9dMQci9sC&amp;pg=PA82">preview</a>
  of the book, where you can read Ms.&nbsp;Törzsök’s translation. I
  trust that five pages of a 737-page book qualifies as fair use,
  and not copyright infringement. The Sanskrit text here is printed
  in Roman letters, using, in addition to the common <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAST">International Alphabet of
  Sanskrit Transliteration</a>, an unconventional notation to help
  with <em>sandhi</em>, but if you find it confusing, just ignore
  all the punctuation <strong>and spaces</strong>, and you’ll be
  able to read it as easily as “normal” IAST.</p>

  <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

  <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

  <p>Ryder may have used a very slightly different text from the
  one here, but the differences are clear and not of much
  importance. This is one of those stories in which the verses are
  of more interest than the simple plot. The “moral” of the
  story—the context in which the story is told—is that one must not
  act without thinking (<em>“ataḥ sarvathā avicāritaṃ karma na
  kartavyam”</em>).</p>

      <h1>The old Tiger and the Traveller</h1>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p></p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day I was wandering in the southern forest and there I
      saw an old tiger who had taken the ceremonial bath and was
      holding a bunch of sacred grass in his paw. He was sitting on
      the edge of a pond and every once in a while he would call
      out: “Travellers! Travellers! Here is a golden bracelet which
      is yours for the taking.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now one and another, after listening to the tiger, became
      frightened, and none would go near him. But by and by there
      came one greedy wayfarer who thought: "This is a lucky
      chance. Yet I suppose I ought not to take so great a risk.
      For I know:</p>
      <pre>
The blessing of a blessing dies,
    If come upon in evil ways;
The very draught that deifies,
    If it be poisoned, slays.
</pre>

      <p>On the other hand, the winning of a good thing always
      involves a certain risk. As the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
To him who never takes a chance,
Fortune her favor never grants;
But to the bold her favor gives,
And he is happy&mdash;if he lives.
</pre>

      <p>Suppose I investigate."</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So he said aloud: “Where is this bracelet of yours?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>The tiger held out his paw and showed the bracelet, but
      the traveller said: “How can I trust a bloodthirsty creature
      like you?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p></p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Listen, good traveller,” answered the tiger, "long ago
      when I was young I was terribly wicked. I killed any number
      of cows and Brahmans and men, and in revenge I don’t know how
      many of my own sons were killed, and my wife too. To-day I am
      alone in the world. Then a certain pious man taught me to
      practise blessed charity, and I am now following his
      teachings. I take my ceremonial bath, I give gifts, I am old,
      my claws and teeth are fallen out, and I show mercy. Why
      should you not trust me? You know yourself what the eight
      cardinal virtues are:</p>
      <pre>
Gifts to God's creatures, gifts to God,
    Study, and penance, self-restraint,
Absence of greed, and lack of fraud,
    And patience: these make up the saint.

Now the first four may practised be
For show, without sincerity;
But the last four are only found
In those whose inmost heart is sound.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now I am so free from greed that, though I hold this
      bracelet of gold in my own paw, I am eager to give it to
      anyone who wants it. But there you have the saying ‘Tiger
      eats man,’ and it is hard to get around it. You know
      yourself:</p>
      <pre>
In ancient ruts the world moves even now;
    And though sage words from harlot lips may flow,
    Men rather heed the Brahman's counsel, though
He may have murdered some unhappy cow.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Besides, I have studied the sacred law. Listen:</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p></p>
      <pre>
As heaven's water in a thirsty place,
    As food to them that faint,
Thrice blest the gift, O pride of Pandu's race,
    Which beggar takes from saint.

Their life to other creatures is as dear,
    As your life is to you;
The saint has pity for another's fear,
    And takes his point of view.

A man may read his duty clear
    In giving&mdash;and withholding too,
In woe and weal, in smile and tear:
    "Just take the other's point of view."
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Furthermore:</p>
      <pre>
Who sees in all that lives his own dear life,
    Who sees in others' wealth a clod, a weed,
As his own mother sees his neighbor's wife,
    He sees, he sees indeed.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now you are a poor man. That is why I am particularly
      anxious to give you this. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Unto the poor give alms, my son,
    Waste not your gold on men of wealth;
With medicine much can be done,
    But not for men in perfect health.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
When place and time are rightly met,
    The gift in duty's name that's given
To one who cannot pay the debt,
    Will help the giver on to heaven.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p></p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Bathe in this pool therefore and then receive the golden
      bracelet."</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the traveller plucked up courage and went down into the
      pool to bathe; but he stuck fast in the mud and could not
      escape.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>The tiger saw that he was stuck, and said: “Aha! You’re
      stuck fast in the mud. I’ll pull you out.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So he crept up very, very slowly and caught hold of the
      traveller, while the traveller was thinking:</p>
      <pre>
Not by theology or Vedic lore
    Can scoundrels win the right to trust complete;
Look at the character; that counts for more:
    The milk of cows is naturally sweet.

The self-baptism of the elephant
    Is like the piety of lustful folk;
The hag beneath her load of gems must pant;
    And sin finds scripture a convenient cloak.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Plainly, I acted foolishly in putting my trust in this
      bloodthirsty creature. The proverb is right:</p>
      <pre>
The things that can claw, and the things that can gore,
    Are very untrustworthy things;
And a man with a sword in his hand, furthermore,
    And rivers and women and kings.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The habits we acquire are little worth;
The nature that was ours before our birth
Will master us, while yet we live on earth.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p></p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And yet again:</p>
      <pre>
The thousand-beamed moon that moves alone&mdash;
    Denying dark to sin&mdash;mid heaven's stars,
Fate's foreordained decree must still atone,
    And meet eclipse, that all her beauty mars.
What power of man can hope to alter now
The lines that fate once wrote upon the infant's brow?"
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While he was turning these matters over in his mind, the
      tiger killed him and ate him.</p>
