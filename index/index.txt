[Arthur W. Ryder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_W._Ryder)
(1877–1938) translated several Sanskrit works into English.
His goal in translation was to produce a work that stood by itself.
At this he was successful.
Especially in translating short memorable Sanskrit verses into 
equally memorable English verse (with metre and rhyme), he has
no equal.
Few other translators from Sanskrit into English manage to do so
without making it sound awkward.

His masterpiece is his translation of the Panchatantra (1925),
which is still popular and in print, but most other translations
of his are still worth reading. 
All his works are now in the public domain. 
(His *Panchatantra* was the only one of his works whose 
copyright was renewed, so it was the last
one to enter the public domain, which it did in 2021.)

A list of translations, along with what's available online (including some only on this website).

• _The Little Clay Cart [Mṛcchakaṭikā]: A Hindu drama_ (1905)

:   This is a translation of _Mṛcchakaṭikā_, by king Śūdraka. It's a pleasant translation with several nice touches,
e.g. in the dialogue of Sansthānaka (Śakāra) he substitutes _sh_ for _s_ just as in the Sanskrit:
_“Shtop, Vasantasenā, shtop! […] Lishten to me, shir!”_

• _Relatives: Being Further Verses Translated from the Sanskrit_ (1919)

:   More verse translations, some short and some long (the longest is the _Caura-pañcāśikā_, 50 stanzas long).

    > The verses here presented are from many sources, and the selections are of very different length and date.
    > The only bond of union is this — that these poems are all taken from the ancient Sanskrit language,
    > and all seemed to the translator worthy of an English rendering.

    This was reprinted in his posthumous volume (see below).

• _The Panchatantra_ (1925)

:   His masterpiece. IMO the most delightful English work translated from Sanskrit ever published.

    This is a translation of the Panchatantra, prose-for-prose and verse-for-verse.
    As with all his other works, Sanskrit verses are translated into English verses with metre and rhyme—something
    few other translators of the Panchatantra have managed, and none so well as here.

    In places he makes it even funnier than the original.

    He also published a selection (subset), under the name
    [Gold's Gloom: Tales from the Panchatantra](https://archive.org/details/goldsgloomtalesf0000unse).

• _The Ten Princes_ (1927)

:   A good translation of Daṇḍin's _Daśa-kumāra-carita_. Apparently Ryder worked on this for 25 years, and considered this his masterpiece.

• _The Bhagavad-gita_ (1929)

:   The same talents and style that made his Panchatantra so delightful
    make this one possibly the most inappropriate translation of the Bhagavad Gita!

    Kees W. Bolle, in his translation of the Bhagavadgītā, who mentions Ryder's *Panchatantra* as the very foremost translation (pp. 222–3):

    > Among the outstanding translations from Sanskrit we have *The Panchatantra* of Arthur W. Ryder,
    > who succeeds magnificently in rendering this most famous and down-to-earth, witty and instructive
    > cycle of stories, and who succeeds even in reproducing the terse metric morals of the tales in laconic
    > little rhymes—as if they were meant that way:
    >
    >            After money has departed,
    >                If the wit is frail,
    >            Then, like rills in summer weather,
    >                Undertakings fail.
    >            
    >            Forest sesame, crow-barley,
    >                Men who have no cash,
    >            Owning names but lacking substance,
    >                Are accounted trash.

    continues with (pp. 235–6, emphasis mine):

    > […] I want to look for a moment at the translation of Arthur W. Ryder. Ryder, as I have already noted,
    > showed himself a genius in translating the Pañcatantra from the Sanskrit.
    > His translation of the Bhagavadgītā, first published in 1929 and reprinted one year later, **is less well known. This is fortunate**
    > […] because of the form his translation took. The “cute” expressions and phrases that served Ryder so well in the popular,
    > entertaining, and edifying tales of the Pañcatantra led to total disaster in this case.
    > Indeed, it is hard to believe that anyone could have taken the work seriously at the time and that a reprint was called for within a year.
    > Ryder maintained rhyme throughout, thereby arriving at such crambo as this:

    and so on.

    Is this "total disaster" of a translation best forgotten, or is there some value nevertheless? Read it and decide:

• _Original Poems: Together with translations from the Sanskrit_ (1939, posthumous)

:   Reprints _Women's Eyes_ and _Relatives_ along with a few previously unpublished verses.
