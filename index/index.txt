[Arthur W. Ryder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_W._Ryder)
(1877–1938) was, in my opinion, the best translator of Sanskrit verse
into English verse — and one of the best translators to translate
Sanskrit without making it awkward. His masterpiece is probably his
translation of the Panchatantra, which is still popular and in print
in India (where it is out of copyright — see below).

A list of translations, along with what's available online (including here).

  **The following are believed to be out of copyright**, as they were published before 1963 and [record](http://collections.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals/)[s](http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~lesk/copyrenew.html) do not indicate their copyright was renewed. In any case, they are out of copyright in India, Australia, etc. and most non-US countries where copyright term for foreign works is at most 70 years past death of author.
