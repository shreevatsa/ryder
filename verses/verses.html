  <p>These are 213 poems (many of them single stanzas) from Sanskrit, published in the posthumous volume of Ryder's
    work.
    Most of them were previously published as the two collections <em>Women's Eyes</em> and
    <em>Relatives</em>, and a few additional ones were previously unpublished.
  </p>

  <p>A <a href="https://archive.org/details/poetrymag09monruoft/page/274/mode/1up">review</a>
    of Ryder's <i>Women's Eyes</i> says that the translation “is done with an engaging dry humor
    in unusually clean-cut English. A little book to buy and cherish” and that is a good summary
    of Ryder's style and talent.</p>

  <p>
    All of Ryder's translations were intended to stand by themselves
    (in fact, they often achieve their effect by different means than the original),
    but on this webpage, wherever I could guess the original Sanskrit
    verse, I've included it, either in full or just a part as a placeholder for the full verse.
    (You can help! Either in locating more originals—thanks to Suhas Mahesh for contributing 60 of these!—or expanding
    the placeholders.)</p>

  [From Preface]
  The maid my true heart loves would not my true love be;
  She seeks another man; another maid loves he;
  And me another maid her own true love would see:
  Oh, fie on her and him and Love and HER and me!

  The world is full of women's eyes,
  Defiant, filled with shy surprise,

  The maid whose youthful beauty flies;

  The rich man, miserly and glum;

  THE DIVINE DECREE
  Thy wise creator wrote upon thy brow,
    When thou wast born, what wealth should once be thine;
  The sum was great perhaps, or small; yet now
    Thy fate is fixed, and sure the law divine.

  For if thou dwell within the desert's bound,
    Thou shalt have nothing less than his decree;
  Nor shall a single penny more be found,
    Although the golden mount thy dwelling be.

  Ah, then be brave and play the manly part,
  Nor be so fond to humble thy proud heart
  And fawn before the rich with cringing art.

  Holds no more water in its little shell

  He has no time for you today-

  He will be angry anyway.

  Is there a man of spirit who would beg
    In broken words that stumble with his sobbing,

  RELATIVES

  I saw some great, wild elephants who
    Were gathered in a ring;
  They saw some men with a lassoo,
    And they began to sing:

  "We fear no fire nor goad nor sling,
    Nor any man that lives;
  We do not fear a single thing
    Except our relatives.

  "For relatives are selfish, mean,
    And always setting traps:
  We understand what we have seen;
    Perhaps we know—PERHAPS.

  "Girls give us hopes, too often vain;
    Cows give us tallow grease;
  Our relatives give us a pain;
    The clergy give us peace.

  "A thirsty bee will kiss a flower,
    And then extract the honey;
  A relative will praise your power,
    And carry off your money.

  "An elephant will bathe his skin,
    Then dust it till it's black;
  A relative will praise his kin,
    And stab them in the back.

  "We fear no fire nor goad nor sling,
    Nor any man that lives;
  We do not fear a single thing

  MANU AND THE FISH

  I
  There was a gentle, holy sage
  Named Manu, in a former age.
  The woes of life he would not blink;
  For many years he did not wink.

  With ragged clothes and frowsy hair
  He lived beside a stream. And there
  He saw a fish who thus began
  To speak to him. "O holy man,

  "I am a little fish, you see;
  And bigger fishes frighten me.
  For bigger fishes eat the small;
  It is their nature, once for all.

  "So dreadful terror weighs me down;
  Besides, I fear that I shall drown.
  Then save me. Some day I will do
  An equal favor, sir, to you:"

  II
  So Manu, when he heard his wish,
  Stretched forth a hand, and took the fish,
  And dropped him in a water-jar
  That was as bright as moonbeams are.

  And in the jar the little fish
  Had everything his heart could wish.
  He grew and thrived on food and fun,
  For Manu loved him like a son.

  At last he grew too big by far
  To live within the water-jar.
  He said: "Good Manu, I would thank
  You very kindly for a tank."

  So Manu took him to a tank
  Eight miles in breadth from bank to bank,
  And twice as long. There, free from fears,
  He lived and grew for many years.

  III
  And when he grew too big to play
  There in a comfortable way,
  He said to Manu: "Pray deliver,
  And put me in the Ganges River.

  "And I will never show you spite,
  But some day help you, as is right.
  My growth has not been selfish; it
  Has happened for your benefit:"

  Kind Manu, anxious to deliver
  His friend, went to the Ganges River,
  And left him happy. As before
  He grew in time a little more.

  And then he said to Manu: "Dear,
  I can no longer wiggle here.
  My holy friend, be good to me,
  And take me quickly to the sea:"

  So Manu took him tenderly
  And traveled quickly to the sea.
  The fish tried not to weigh too much,
  And to be nice to smell and touch.

  IV
  The fish, when he had reached the ocean,
  Smiled at his holy friend's devotion,
  And said: "O kind and holy man,
  You do as much as fathers can.

  "And now 'tis time for me to do
  A little something, dear, for you.
  For you must know, my holy friend,
  The world is hastening to its end.

  "A dreadful time is near at hand
  For all the things that move or stand;
  There comes a flood that has no bound,
  And everybody will be drowned.

  "So build a ship and build it strong:
  Put ropes on board both stout and long.
  And one thing further you will need,
  Neat packages of every seed.

  "Embark then with the seven seers,
  And wait, good Manu, free from fears,
  Until I come. And you will see
  A horn upon the head of me.

  "Till then, farewell. Do not delay.
  The danger grows from day to day:"

  v
  Then Manu packed most carefully
  The seeds, and straightway put to sea.
  His good ship gently rose and fell
  Upon the ocean's mighty swell.

  He longed to see the friendly fish,
  Who came in answer to the wish.
  He seemed a floating mountain dread;
  A horn was growing on his head.

  So Manu, feeling less forlorn,
  Fastened a rope about the horn,
  And felt the ship glide speedily
  Over the dancing, salty sea.

  But when the wind began to roar
  And ocean thundered more and more,
  The tossing, shaken ship began
  To stagger like a drunken man.

  No land remained to cheer them there,
  But only water, sky, and air;
  No life through all those many years
  Save Manu, fish, and seven seers.

  But Manu, all those many years,
  Went sailing with the seven seers;
  The fish pulled on with might and main
  And did not weary nor complain.

  At last he did, however, stop
  Beside the highest mountain-top,
  And bade them tie the ship; and they
  Call it Ship Mountain to this day.

  VI
  And then, with wide, unwinking eyes,
  The fish, to Manu's great surprise,
  Declared: "I saved the seven seers
  From death and agonizing fears;

  "For I am Brahma. And my friend,
  Kind Manu, who has seen the end
  Of all the world, shall make again
  Gods, devils, animals, and men:'

  And so he disappeared. But they,
  Amazed, departed on their way,
  While kindly Manu made again
  Gods, devils, animals, and men.

  Now all have heard who had the wish
  The tale of Manu and the fish.
  And everyone who takes it in,
  Shall be forever free from sin.

  THOUGHTS ON HAVING ONE'S WIFE
        STOLEN BY A GIANT

  From the _Ramayana_. This is the lament of the hero Rama, when
  his wife Sita is carried away by Ravan, the giant king of Ceylon.

  They say that as the seasons move,
    Our sorrow gently fades away;
  But I am far from her I love
    And sorrow deepens every day.

  That she is gone, is not my woe;
    That she was reft, is not my pain;
  The thought that agonizes so
    Is this; her youth is spent in vain.

  Blow, breezes, blow to her dear face;
    Blow back to me her kisses sweet:
  Through you we taste a glad embrace,
    And in the moon our glances meet.

  When she was torn away from me,
    "My lord! My love!" was all her cry,
  Which tortures me incessantly;
    My heart is poisoned, and I die.

  I burn upon an awful pyre;
    My body wastes by day and night;
  Her loss is fuel to feed the fire
    That burns so pitilessly white.

  If I could leave each loving friend,
    Could sink beneath the sea, and sleep,
  Perhaps the fire of love would end,
    If I could slumber in the deep.

  One thought consoles my worst distress;
    Through this I live: I cannot die
  While she lies down in loveliness
    Upon the selfsame earth as I.

  The sun-parched rice, no longer wet,
    Lives on, while earth her moisture gives;
  The root of love supports me yet,
    For they have told me that she lives.

  Though giants hem her round, yet soon
    She shall be freed, and shall arise
  As radiantly as the moon
    From clouds that darken autumn skies.

  When shall I pierce the giant's breast
    With shafts that suck his life away,
  That give my tortured darling rest
    And all her absent griefs allay?

  When shall I feel the close embrace
    Of my good goddess, as in dreams?
  When kiss her smile, while on her face
    The water born of gladness gleams?

  When shall I pluck from out my heart—
    A heart by woes of absence torn—
  The pain of life from love apart,
    Forget it, like a garment worn?

    SIMPLE JUSTICE

  If, maiden of the lotus eye,
    Your anger hurts you so,
  'Tis right you should not let it die,

  POT-EAR'S AWAKENING

  From the Ramayana. When the giant citadel in Ceylon was invested
  by Rama and his army, the giant king determined to call to his
  assistance his most redoubtable subject, Pot-ear. The giant was normally
  awake only one day every six months. He must therefore be awakened
  before he can employ his great strength and courage in the giant
  cause.

  I
  They started forth, the giant band
  Obedient to their king's command,
  With flesh and blood as tempting food,
  With wreaths and perfumes, sweet and good.

  And so they came to Pot-ear's door,
  Where stretched the cave a league and more
  On every side, where blossoms sweet
  Poured fragrance forth, a guest to greet.

  And all that mighty giant band
  Before his snoring scarce could stand;
  They tottered, but with spirit brave
  They fought their way into the cave.

  There Pot-ear stretched this way and that
  Just like a mountain tumbled flat,
  Hideous in his slumber deep,
  For he was very sound asleep.

  They saw him bristle, saw him shake;
  They heard him hissing like a snake;
  They felt his breathing like a storm
  That blew them from his ugly form.

  They saw his nostrils sink and swell,
  His throat that yawned like gates of hell;
  The dreadful, sprawling form they saw
  That smelt of dinners eaten raw.

  They made a mountain of the food
  That they had brought, so sweet and good;
  Beside his bed the mountain rose
  Of deer and boars and buffaloes.

  They grasped their trumpets glittering bright
  As moonbeams shining in the night;
  Impatiently they blew and blew,
  And screamed and howled and shouted, too.

  Through all the tumult loud and deep
  Pot-ear lay snoring, fast asleep;
  They saw he did not mind their clamor
  And seized a stone, or club, or hammer.

  They tumbled boulders on his chest,
  To see if they could break his rest.
  They beat a hundred rub-a-dubs
  With fists and hammers, bars and clubs.

  The only answer was a snore
  A little deeper than before
  That blew away the giant band;
  Before his breath that could not stand.

  More sternly yet the giants strove:
  With sticks and whips and goads they drove
  Horses and elephants abreast, Asses
  and camels on his chest.

  They dubbed and pounded without pity,
  Until the tumult filled the city;
  They made the woods and mountains shake,
  But giant Pot-ear would not wake.

  Then anger filled each giant breast;
  They swore that they would break his rest.
  One last attack they made at length
  With all their might and wrath and strength.

  And there were some to beat the drum,
  While screamed and howled and shouted some;
  Some bit his ears, while some would tear
  Away great handfuls of his hair.

  A hundred water-pots they poured
  Into his ears, and still he snored;
  They could not shake his slumber deep;
  Pot-ear was very sound asleep.

  Some took a hammer or a club,
  With all their might began to drub
  Upon his chest and limbs and head
  To wake him from his drowsy bed.

  They tied great, spiky stones to ropes
  And dragged them over him; their hopes
  Were disappointed still; for he
  Slept on with peaceful dignity.

  But when a thousand elephants
  Upon his chest began to dance,
  Then Pot-ear, gently tickled, broke
  From bonds of slumber, and awoke.

  He did not heed the falling stones
  Or dubs that rattled on his bones,
  But yawned and raised himself to see
  What breakfast might provided be.

  The giants pointed to the food
  That they had brought, so sweet and good;
  Then Pot-ear in his might arose
  And ate some boars and buffaloes.

  II
  Now when the meat, with wine afloat,
  Had vanished down his mighty throat,
  Dull Pot-ear shook his heavy head,
  And rolled his sleepy eyes, and said:

  "Great matters surely are at stake,
  Or I should hardly be awake;
  And for our giant king, I will
  Cool fire or overturn a hill.

  "But tell me why I am awake;
  Surely great matters are at stake."
  Then giant Post-eye bent him low
  And humbly answered: "Pot-ear, know

  "That neither gods nor devils can
  Affright us—but we fear a man.
  He leads his mountainous apes across
  The strait, for grief at Sita's loss.

  "One ape has burned our splendid town
  And he has struck Prince Aksha down.
  While Ravan, heaven's scourge and thorn,
  Has been by Rama overborne

  "In single fight, and has been spared—
  A thing no god or devil dared:"
  Then Pot-ear rolled his eyes, and said:
  "Well, I will strike the monkeys dead,

  "With Lakshmana and Rama, and
  Before our king as victor stand.
  And monkey flesh and blood shall be
  Your food—the blood of men for me:"

  But when he heard this boasting grim,
  The giant Great-paunch answered him:

  "Nay, first consider everything,
  And listen humbly to the king:
  And after that, it will be right
  To meet your enemy, and fight:"

  So Pot-ear, rising. took a cup
  And drank, to keep his courage up;
  He drank two thousand jars of wine,
  And washed his face, and made it shine.

  Eager, excited, haughty, proud,
  He towered above the giant crowd;
  And as he strode his king to greet,
  Earth trembled underneath his feet.

  III
  On, to his brother's proud abode,
  Half-drunk with sleep and wine, he strode;
  Red-eyed with wrath, he bowed him low,
  And asked, "Why was I wakened so?

  "What danger threatens, or what ill?
  Whom would you like to have me kill?"
  And Ravan, maddened by his wrong.
  Said: "Brother, you have slept too long;

  "So all the wickedness and woe
  That Rama works, you do not know;
  How he has built a bridge, and crossed
  The channel with a monkey host.

  "Behold their strangely hideous shapes!
  See Lanka's groves, one sea of apes!
  They kill our bravest when we fight;
  For who can conquer monkey might?

  "Ah, brother, save your stricken nation,
  Your king reduced to supplication;
  You know I love you and adore you;
  I know how devils flee before you.

  "For there is none on earth so strong
  As you, to right my grievous wrong;
  Scatter and tear the monkey crowds
  Like wind among the autumn clouds:'

  IV
  Then Pot-ear laughed aloud and said:
  "Refusing, Ravan, to be led
  By us and our united sense,
  You suffer now the consequence.

  "Whoever scorns a mighty foe,
  Is certain to be stricken low;
  Whoever fails to guard his own
  High place, is quickly overthrown."

  Then Ravan frowned, and in his grim,
  Gigantic fashion, answered him:
  "Enough of sermonizing! Hold,
  Be silent; do as you are told.

  "Although it might be true I had
  Been headstrong, ill-advised, or mad,
  You, as a younger brother, should
  Forget, and turn the sin to good.

  "So, if you have a warrior's might,
  Or if you love your brother, fight!
  Or if you would not, sulk apart
  While trouble makes me sad at heart.

  "He only is a friend indeed
  Who aids his sinful friend in need,
  Who indefatigably gives
  A helping hand to relatives:"

  V
  Then Pot-ear felt his brother's woe,
  And answered softly, soothing, slow:
  "Forget your sorrow, O my king;
  Take heart at my encouraging.

  "Grieve not. Am I not here, to kill
  The wretched man that thwarts your will?
  And what I said, I said to prove
  My sympathy and brother's love.

  "In battle's forefront I will slay
  Rama, and chase his apes away;
  His severed head shall bring relief
  And joy to you; to Sita, grief.

  "The giants mourning for their slain
  Shall soon forget their grief again;
  For I will wipe their tears away
  As joyfully I slay and slay.

  "Then grieve not, brother mine, but send
  Me forth, your toils and wars to end;
  For none can stand before my face
  With spear or arrow, sword or mace.

  "Soon Rama and his brother shall
  Be dead, with all inimical,
  O King. to you—god, ape, or man;
  I wish to kill them, and I can.

  "Yes, I would drink the sea, eat fire,
  Slay Death himself, should you desire;
  Would crush the mountains, pierce the earth,
  Smite sun and stars, to bring you mirth,

  "And food to me. I sleep so long
  And grow so hungry and so strong
  That earth and heaven and hell would be
  A not too bounteous meal for me.

  "Rejoice, and let your heart incline
  To every pleasure rare and fine,
  And murmur, as you sip your wine:
  'Sita is mine, forever mine.'"

  VI
  But giant Great-paunch counseled so:
  "He likes to talk, but does not know
  The right and wrong, this vulgar whelp;
  King Ravan is our only help.

  "Recall the havoc in our clan
  That Rama wrought in Janasthan;
  The angry lion would you wake,
  Or irritate the sleeping snake?"

  To Ravan turning then, he said:
  "Sita you seized and hither led
  Her; now subdue her to your will,
  If you desire her beauty still.

  "And listen to my plan, wherethrough
  She may bemade to favor you—
  Proclaim in every street today
  That heroes five go forth to slay

  "Prince Rama—Pot-ear, Cleaver, and
  Fork-tongue, Roarer, I who stand
  Before you. We will bravely fight,
  Struggling with all our main and might.

  "And if we conquer, well and good;
  At worst, we shall be dripping blood
  When we return and say that we
  Devoured your bitter enemy.

  "And then proclaim throughout the town
  That Rama has been stricken down
  With Lakshman and the monkey host;
  And give to them you honor most

  "Garlands and slaves and such rewards
  As your rich treasury affords.
  Then, when the rumor has been spread
  Of Rama and his army dead,

  "Go, comfort Sita, speak her fair,
  And give her jewels to deck her hair.
  Her grief, combined with your deceit,
  Will lay her grateful at your feet.

  "She is a woman, helpless, bred
  To ease; and if her lord is dead,
  Or dead to her, she can but wive
  With you, a lord to her alive."

  VII
  Then Pot-ear answered: "I will slay
  Rama, and wipe your fear away;
  When heroes promise you a wonder,
  Their boasting is no empty thunder.

  "While cowards and flatterers like you
  Make ill anticipation true,
  I fight, to win revenge again
  For treasure lost and giants slain:'

  Then Ravan laughed aloud and said:
  "I fancy Great-paunch is afraid;
  Go forth, brave Pot-ear, fight, and save
  My honor: you alone are brave.

  "And when they see your awful shape,
  Terror will seize on every ape;
  And Rama's heart and Lakshman's too
  Will split with dread on seeing you."

  So Ravan, knowing Pot-ear's might,
  Rejoiced, and felt his heart grow light;
  While Pot-ear grasped, his foe to strike,
  His trusty, gold-bespangled pike—

  The pike that gods and devils feared,
  Made of black iron, in spots besmeared
  With many a stain and blotch of red,
  By foemen's blood contributed.

  Then, maddened by the reek of blood,
  To the great city wall he strode,
  While flowers and prayers upon him fell,
  And drums and trumpets wished him well.

  And there he paused and spoke: "Today
  Shall all the monkeys fade away
  Like moths in flame. I would not care
  To hunt them in their forest lair;

  "Indeed, the species often proves
  Quite ornamental in our groves;
  But Rama is the cause of all
  Our woe; so he and his must fall."

  He spoke, nor heeded signs of ill
  That waited on his footsteps still—
  The sky as red as asses' skin,
  The clouds with lightning mingled in,

  The jackals spitting fire on high,
  The throbbing arm, the twitching eye,
  The vulture on his pikestaff croaking,
  The thunderbolt before him smoking.

  He heeded not, but leaped the wall,
  Obeying thus the certain call
  Of Death; and straight the monkey crowds
  Scattered and fled like riven clouds.

  But Angad called: "Why would you flee
  Like apes of mean or no degree?
  Return, and prove your valor; thus
  He shall not prove a match for us:"

  Ashamed, they seized upon great boulders
  Or lifted trees upon their shoulders;
  The trees were splintered, striking him;
  Rocks split upon his every limb.

  While underneath his blows they bled
  And swooned and died, or turned and fled;
  Till Angad called them back to fight,
  Reproving thus their shameless flight:

  "Why save your lives? Why run away
  Like cowards? What will the women say?
  For high-born monkeys may not flee
  Like vulgar apes of no degree.

  "And if we fight our best and die,
  We win a hero's home on high;
  If victory should crown our worth,
  We win a hero's name on earth:"

  "But life is dear to us,' they said,
  "And Pot-ear quickly strikes us dead:"
  Yet,rallying to their prince's name,
  They fought once more for very shame.

  VIII
  They sought for courage in despair;
  For wounds and death they did not care,
  Nor for their scores and hundreds slain
  And eaten on the battle-plain.

  Then great Hanuman hurled a shower
  Of boulders, using all his power;
  But Pot-ear answered with a blow
  From that fierce pike, that laid him low.

  The mountain crag that Nila hurled
  He caught, as through the air it whirled,
  And powdered it, till sparks and flame
  Forth from the tortured missile came.

  Then monkeys by the thousand poured
  Upon him, bit and tore and roared;
  Even as they clawed and gashed and smote,
  They vanished in their hell, his throat.

  Even King Sugriva could not kill
  His foe, nor Angad, struggling still;
  Even Lakshman with an arrow-shower
  Could not subdue his giant power.

  "With Rama only will I fight;"
  Cried Pot-ear: "then will put to flight,
  When he is dead, your warriors all";
  And Rama answered Pot-ear's call

  With shafts that pierced his shaggy chest;
  Then, spitting fire, with bleeding breast,
  He charged, but from his weakened hand
  The weapons dropped upon the sand.

  Yet with bare, weakened hands he slew
  Two hundred monkeys as they flew
  Upon him; then, with tempest-shock
  He hurled a craggy, ponderous rock

  At Rama, who evaded it,
  While Pot-ear, in a foaming fit,
  Turned, licking bloody chops, and slew
  Of monkey warriors not a few,

  And hoarsely laughing, shouted so:
  "Rama, I am no common foe
  Like those that you have slain; this club
  With which I have been wont to drub

  "The gods and devils, you shall feel
  As it prepares you for my meal:"
  An answering arrow cut away
  The right arm and the club: they lay

  Immense: a second arrow sped
  And shore away his bleeding head,
  Which tumbled, grinning horribly,
  Among the fishes in the sea.

  Then choirs of heaven praised the might
  Of Rama in that dreadful fight;
  And monkey faces blossomed bright
  Like lilies in the glad sunlight.

  IX
  But in the city Ravan kept
  A tortured vigil, moaned, and wept:

  "Ah, Pot-ear! Source of all my hope and gladness!
    Where are you flown,
  Leaving unplucked your brother's thorn of sadness,
    Dying alone?

  "My right arm were you; you I trusted only,
    Death's match! And can
  The tamer of high gods be sleeping lonely,
  Slain by a man?

  "The gods rejoice, forgetting all their anguish
    Foes not a few
  Soon will assail the fortress where I languish
    Grieving for you.

  "I am no king, nor Sita's lover longer—
    Till I shall give
  Battle to Rama, prove myself the stronger,
    Vainly I live,

  "And should it be his lot to slay another
    Gladly I die;
  Beside the headless form that was my brother,
    There let me lie."

  FORTITUDE

  From the _Mahabharata_. This is the consolation offered
  to those who have lost kinsmen in the great epic war.

  All gathering ends in dissipation;
    All heaps, at last, must fall;
  All friendships melt in separation;
    And death at last ends all.

  The coward dies, the hero lives
    A space, but none pass by
  The appointed days that heaven gives—
    Then let us fighting die.

  All lives begin from nothingness,
    Stir for a time, and then
  (No cause for grief) sink into less
    Than nothingness again.

  Death has no enemy nor friend;
    Each in his turn must pass,
  Must helpless to that bidding bend
    As wind-blown blades of grass.

  Our goal is—there. And every day
    The one long caravan
  Moves on with death to point the way.
    Why should it grieve a man?

  For all the saints and scholars old
    Since first the world began
  Are gone, with every fighter bold.
    Why should it grieve a man?

  The fighter slain attains to heaven;
    The other wins the fight;
  To each is much advantage given;
    Fighting is good and right.

  And God, who loves a fighting man,
    Hailing a welcome guest,
  Prepares with all the care he can,
    A seat among the blest.

  Oh, trust yourself, and spare your tears
    For those who fell in strife;
  Not all your sorrow, pain, and fears
    Can bring the dead to life.

  Hundreds of parents, sons, and wives
    Loved you with passion true;
  Gone are the loves of former lives—
    What do they mean to you?

  Time makes us win our strength, and keep;
    Time tells us when to die;
  Time is awake when others sleep;
    Time passes no man by.

  Youth vanishes. and beauty, wealth,
    And love and friendship die
  With life itself and living health;
    But wise men do not cry.

  They do not cry, but fight; and then
    Forget their former woes;
  For pain forgotten is not pain,
    But pain remembered, grows.

  This wisdom heals the heart's dull woes
    As herbs the body's pain;
  When palliating wisdom grows,
    We are not children then.

  One thing remains of all our loves,
    Our wealth and honors won—
  The character that onward moves,
    The deeds that we have done.

  Man has no enemy nor friend
    Except himself; alone
  He knows what deeds to virtue tend,
    What seeds of sin are sown.

  HYMN TO FAITH

  By Faith the holy fire is lit,
    And sung the liturgy;
  We pray to Faith with all our wit
    For prosperous piety.

  Give wealth, O Faith, to me who give
    Such worship as I can;
  Make me respected, make me live
    A rich, religious man.

  The gods have faith from imps, I see;
   For what they will, they can;
  Enlarge my prosperous piety
    As a rich, religious man.

  Gods worship Faith, and pious men
    Must worship every hour;
  If faith first fills our bosoms, then
    Faith gives us wealth and power.

  We call on Faith by morning's light,
    On Faith in glare of day,
  On Faith when evening sinks to night:
  o Faith, give faith to pray!

  DRONA'S DEATH
  From the _Mahabharata_. Drona is the eighty-year-old hero who had
  instructed the heroes of both the opposing armies in the use of arms.

  While Drona led the Kuru van,
  The Pandu army to a man
  Was beaten back and strove in vain
  To dominate the battle-plain.

  Where tramp and clash of battle grew
  Like crackling flames in dry bamboo,
  There Drona blazed, a smokeless fire
  That fed on death and mounted higher.

  Where aged Drana's arrows passed,
  Horse, man, and tusker breathed their last.
  Like hissing snakes his arrows sped
  And left a trail of reeking red.

  The Pandu army fought in vain
  Against him. They had all been slain,
  Had not they striven to beguile
  Their foe with false and wicked wile.

  For Bhima cried aloud and said:
  "Old man, your son is stark and dead.

  "As silly simpletons will fight
  For wife and child and money bright,
  So you have fought-and all for one,
  Your dearly loved, your only son:

  "Who studied in the school of strife,
  And paid his lesson with his life.
  Dead on the plain his body lies
  A prey to all that creeps and flies."

  The father heard the lie, and slow
  His hand released the fatal bow;
  He sank, yet roused himself again
  In one strong cry: "Fight on, my men!

  "Destroy the treacherous Pandu line,
  But hope no more for aid of mine.
  All hatred dies from out my breast;
  Remains religion's peaceful rest."

  His foe believed the Brahman's word
  And darted with uplifted sword
  To pierce him through, while all the men
  And all the horses shrieked in pain.

  But Drona, in ecstatic prayer,
  Knew not his foe was standing there;
  Wrapped in inviolable fire,
  He thought on God with pure desire.

  We saw his lifted face; we heard
  His murmuring lips pronounce the word
  "Amen!" We felt him pray; at last
  We knew his hero soul had passed.

  For while his body tumbled dead,
  A flame flashed from his cloven head;
  His soul flew in the flame above
  To dwell with God in deathless love.

  There were but five of mortal birth
  Who saw his spirit leave the earth;
  Who heard the choirs of angels sing
  Divinely in their welcoming;

  Saw heaven's everlasting fire
  Flash out, and flicker, and expire;
  And knew that he was with the saints
  Where God's love wearies not nor faints.

  But all could see the bloody corse,
  By arrows torn and trampling horse;
  All sorrowed for the evil done
  Save one insatiate foe alone,

  Who scorned our hero's eighty years
  And scant hair gray behind the ears;
  He hacked the body from the head,
  To show his hatred for the dead.

  And all the army fled away;
  Where Drona died, they could not stay;
  But Drona's spirit dwells on high
  Among the stars that light the sky.

  OPTIMISM

  Toward Death we move with every breath;
    Death dogs us every day;
  However far we journey, Death
    Is never far away.

  We laugh to see the rising sun,
    And laugh to see him set;
  Nor think that when the day is done,
    Our days are fewer yet.

  Our hearts are warm to each new spring,
    Each summer, winter, fall;
  But what the passing seasons bring
    Is only Death to all.

  As log collides with log upon
    The sea, and parts again,
  So friend and gold and wife and son
    Love and abandon men.

  As if a traveler should meet
    A hurrying caravan,
  And say:"I too with willing feet
    Will follow as I can;"

  So to the long parade we cleave
    That with the world began:
  Then do not grieve, you cannot leave
    The social caravan.

  The hours of youth grow ever less;
    No river climbs the hill;
  Then turn your thoughts to happiness,
    Which is your portion still.

  THE THIEF'S SONG
  The _Chaura-panchashika_  of the poet Bilhana, who lived in Kashmir
  in the eleventh century. The thief has stolen a princess' heart, and
  has been thrown into prison, on the discovery of the intrigue, by the
  irate father. While awaiting the king's pleasure, he writes his song,
  which comes to the royal ear, procuring him liberty and the legitimation
  of his love. The verbal trick of the translation is found also
  in the Sanskrit.

  As then she was, I think of her today:
    The face that blossomed as she woke from sleep,
  The slender waist, the golden champaks gay,
    The self-surrendering love; and I must weep
    For magic happiness I could not keep.

  If I could see her once again today,
    Fair as the moon, as beautifully pale,
  Full-bosomed, love-sick, bearing queenly sway
    O'er youth and charm, that only would avail
    To heal my fever, and to make me hale.

  If I could see her lotus-eyes today,
    The breast that into sloping shoulders slips,
  Would I not clasp her in my arms straightway
    And drink the maddening honey of her lips,
    Drunk like the bee that from the lotus sips!

  In prison I remember her today:
    Dark curls against the pallor of her cheek;
  The soft resistance as she strove to stay
    My eager love with arms around my neck—
    Yet shamed, and even in her resisting, meek.

  Awaiting death, I think of her today:
    Of her sweet face, her timid, downward glance,
  Her eyes that in their restlessness betray
    The madness of love's long and waking trance—
    Queen-swan among love's flowering lily-plants!

  If I could see her in my cell today,
    If arms that yearn for her could but receive her,
  My best of love should comfort her, should slay
    The absence and the sorrows that bereave her,
    I'd close my eyes, and never, never leave her.

  A vision comes to comfort me today,
    A slender form that gives to dance a grace
  Unknown before with beauties that obey
    Love's bidding, and a pale but shining face,
    And earrings that in air strange patterns trace.

  And I remember in my bonds today,
    How she, with soft, smooth sandal-powder sweet,
  And musk diffusing pungent perfume, lay
    Upon her couch, how arching brows would greet
    Her lovely eyes, like lips that kissing meet.

  Here, chained and fettered, I recall today,
    The slender form, eyes veiled in modest fear,
  The wine-sweet lips I kissed in loving play,
    The musk, the saffron of my own Kashmir,
    Betel, and camphor, that to her were dear.

  The crowning moment I recall today,
    When all her soul is given to my lips,
  When, clad in love's warm, golden, glad army,
    My darling from the hated palace slips,
    Like to the moon delivered from eclipse.

  But slighter joys are in my mind today,
    How once a lovers' quarrel checked our glee;
  Then when I sneezed, the princess would not say
    "God bless you!" but with silent coquetry
    Stuck blossoms in her hair, to madden me.

  Another picture visits me today:
    The drops of weariness that oft would seek
  To make upon her face a pearl inlay
    When love had left her pale and worn and weak;
    The golden earring that would fret her cheek.

  I seem to see her lovely breast today,
    The skirt that tripped her quick steps on the floor,
  The glance that modesty would lead astray
    And love bring back to me, the lips grown sore
    Because I would be kissing evermore.

  I seem to see my princess-bride today
    Moving with swanlike, undulating grace,
  And in her hand a red ashoka-spray,
    Pearl necklace on her breast in close embrace,
    Quick smiles that light the pallor of her face.

  I see her gold-bespangled dress today
    Held as a frail defending shield, the pain
  Of my too eager passion to allay,
    Clutched tightly as she struggles once again
    For very shame to leave me—but in vain.

  Her golden bracelets haunt my thoughts today,
    Her restless eyes that pierce a gloom like this
  As memories that none can take away,
    The teeth of pearl, red lips, the secret bliss,
    The wealth of hair that fresh-picked blossoms kiss.

  That wealth of hair I seem to see today
    When ribbons break and flowers begin to fall;
  Then heaven is opened in the dazzling ray
    Of her dear smile; at love's imperious call
    We sink in bliss that none may share at all.

  And I remember in my cell today
    How she would come to find me through the night.
  Guided by beams illumining her way
    From lamps that glitter with a gemlike light
    On her shamed face, and mine with kindness bright.

  Well I remember thee, my love, today:
    Thy startled eyes as of a gentle deer,
  Thy body wasting at the least delay
    Of love, thy graceful gait, thy teeth so dear—
    Delights of heaven transplanted to Kashmir!

  I hear the echo of thy laugh today:
    I see thy bosom quiver in sheer glee;
  I see the necklace, darting beams that stray
    About thy neck; sure, Love has planted thee
    Upon a hill, his bright flower-flag to be!

  Yes, I can hear through dungeon-walls today
    Sweet flatteries of thine, when, soon or late,
  Passion grew weary in its house of clay;
    I hear the parrot quaintly imitate,
    Learning soft words to utter to her mate.

  Even as in prison I recall today
    The limp, surrendered form, the luscious hair,
  The half-shut eyes, the swanlike, queenly play
    In love's bright lotus-pool, I cannot bear,
    In death or life, to be without her there.

  If I could see her once again today
    At sunset, see her fawnlike, gracious eyes,
  If on her heavenly bosom I could lay
    My cheek and rest—oh, I should quite despise
    The saint, the king, the blest in Paradise.

  For I remember fervently today
    Her beauty perfect in its every part,
  To which all other lovely women pay
    Their homage, for 'tis far beyond their art—
    Queen of love's drama, mistress of my heart!

  I could not, if I would, forget today
    Even for a moment, such a wondrous wife,
  So young, so helpless that she seems to pray
    For pity, stabbed by love as by a knife,
    Nearer than garments are, more dear than life.

  The vision of her beauty comes today
    To make all other beauty seem awry.
  To shame the pride of women, and to slay
    Men's hearts by hundreds; and I know that I,
    Consumed by absent fires, shall surely die.

  Heroic wisdom, teach me how today
    To act, to save a life than life more dear,
  And deeds of heaven's heroes to outweigh;
    For well I know that death is creeping near,
    And for my bride, my brave, true bride, I fear.

  My bride! And must I think of her today
    With bright eyes dimmed by sorrow and by fears,
  With light feet treading slow the future gray;
    I hear her voice come stumblingly through tears,
    And see her bowed by woe through endless years.

  For I have never seen, nor see today
    A face that with my darling's could compare,
  Though all the rival world should challenge. Nay,
    The sweetness of Love's wife is not so rare;
    The moon itself is not so spotless fair.

  Her wealth of wondrous hair I see today,
    Her teeth of pearl; and I remember well
  How sorrow in her presence would not stay;
    How union with my bride would ever spell
    The bliss of heaven; one moment's absence, hell.

  The last grim moment I recall today
    When from her palace slaves that seemed to be
  Resistless slaves of Death, tore me away,
    And all her prayers for me were vain; yet she
    Still gazed and gazed. That gaze still tortures me.

  I think with anguish of her face today—
    The face that in its beauty overbore
  The wonder of the moon's unclouded ray—
    Because upon that face I may not pore
    Again, and yet again, and evermore.

  I think of her, my hope of life, today,
    How she would listen with her mind and heart
  To all I said. My maiden young and gay,
    Thy youth was mine alone, thine artless art,
    And shall be mine again, though death us part.

  And I recall what I have lost today,
    How she would move in such sweet perfume clad
  That bees would gather round her cheek alway;
    The very tinkle that her bracelets had
    When she would fix her hair, will drive me mad.

  And I remember woefully today
    How gently I would waken her, while she
  Would shiver, and her startled eyes would stray,
    Unable yet our love's new day to see—
    She wakes, starts back, then recognizes me.

  And I recall another hour today
    When, jealous, she would leave me. I entreat
  Her, and she does not turn her face away
    But weeps when kissed. I fall before her feet:
    "Be gracious to thine humble servant, sweet.

  "Thou canst not think that I would fall today
    In thy bedchamber, victim to the glance
  Of others, I, the subject of thy sway—
    Far rather would I perish in a trance
    Of thy dear kisses, playfulness, and dance."

  I wonder, as I think of her today,
    If she be heaven's queen come down to earth,
  Or Shiva's bride, or Vishnu's. Or she may
    Be God's own thought of beauty in mortal birth,
    To drive men mad with woman's perfect worth.

  There is no man that lives on earth today
    Who could depict her; none but me has seen
  Such beauty. Should the king of heaven essay
    The task, with memories of his heavenly queen,
    He might succeed. None other could, I ween.

  And I remember in my cell today
    How she would stop her ears in graceful fun.
  No other face like hers is lovely.
    Yea, And if her form blots out beneath the sun
    All other beauty, why, what harm is done?

  No doubt her heavenly features keep today
    The pallid splendor of the autumn moon,
  And trip the saint on his ascetic way:
    Would I might gain the glory lost so soon,
    And lose no more forever such a boon!

  Ah, yes, if I might plunge again today
    Beneath love's waters that so long I miss,
  Might save love's lotus-blossom from decay
    And share with her the heaven of a kiss,
    I'd give my life for one such moment's bliss!

  Though lovely women walk the world today
    By tens of thousands, there is none so fair
  In all that exhibition and display
    With her most perfect beauty to compare—
    This is my consolation, and my care.

  As then she floated, so she floats today
    A swan-queen, down the river of my mind
  O'er waves that thrill beneath her plumage gay;
    She leaves my admiration far behind,
    And flying dust of blossoms turns me blind.

  In sadness I remember her today,
   The daughter of my king, whom love has driven
  To me with timid, eager eyes—then say,
    Was she a goddess, or a nymph of heaven,
    Angel, or fairy, to my longings given?

  I cannot for an hour forget today
    From dawn until the evening sinks in night
  How, sleeping, she would gather beauty; nay,
    Her form seemed slenderer, her breast more white,
    Her gems more radiant yet, by morning's light.

  Her golden beauty comes to me today,
    Her slow, coquettish grace, as she would lie
  In shamed humility upon her couch, would pray
    For maddening love and kisses. Oh, might I
    Taste that elixir now, I could not die.

  I could not die, might I enjoy today
    That bliss so deep as almost to be woe;
  We hardly knew if it were war or play,
    So fiercely did we clasp each other, so
    Fire-hot with passion did our faces glow.

  How could I, after that, endure today
    The subtlest fascinations of another?
  Far rather would I end my life straightway;
    Come quickly, Death! Come as a kindly brother,
    With one swift act my spark of life to smother.

  God Shiva has his poison even today;
    The ocean guards his awful, hidden fire;
  The tortoise bears upon his back alway
    The burden of the earth. However dire
    The things they love, they keep what they desire.

    SIMPLE DEER-HORN

      I
  Young Deer-horn was a pious youth
  Devoted to religious truth,
  A hermit innocently good
  Who grew to manhood in the wood.

  His mother left him at his birth;
  He only knew one soul on earth,
  His austere father; therefore he
  Grew up in natural piety.

  Now in a kingdom near at hand
  No rain had fallen on the land,
  Prevented by the magic skill
  Of priests the king had treated ill.

  An aged priest advised the king:
  "Propitiate the clergy; bring
  Pure-minded Deer-horn from the wood,
  That hermit innocently good.

  "He dwells in purity afar;
  He does not know what women are:
  Fetch him, and then the rain will fall;
  Of this I have no doubt at all:"

  The counsel pleased the king; he planned
  To entertain the hermit, and
  Invited women of the town
  To go and bring young Deer-horn down.

  But they refused the royal plan,
  Fearing to meet a holy man;
  At last an aged crone's ambition
  Drove her to undertake the mission.

  "If you will give me what I ask;'
  She said, "I can fulfill the task;
  But I require a rich reward
  Of gold and gems, my royal lord:"

  With royal bounty richly laden,
  She took her child, a youthful maiden
  More known as beautiful than good,
  And so departed to the wood.

      II
  She waited till the coast was clear,
  And then she sent her daughter dear
  To interview the hermit who
  Had never learned what women do.

  The maiden found the lad and said:
  "I trust your pious life is led
  Without offense, and that your food
  Of roots and fruits is sweet and good.

  "I trust your father's heart is blest
  With deep religious peace and rest;
  For I am hither come to see
  Your unpretending piety."

  And Deer-horn answered: "Sir, you are
  As radiant as a beaming star;
  I never saw a man like you;
  Then tell me, sir, what shall I do

  "To make you happy? Here are roots,
  Water, a couch of skins, and fruits.
  What vows are yours, most holy sage?
  Where is your pious hermitage?"

  "My hermitage;' the maid replied,
  "Is three long leagues from here, beside
  The river; there I practice now
  A fearfully ascetic vow.

  "For I have sworn that I will greet
  Such other hermits as I meet;
  And I must clasp and kiss you too—
  So my religion bids me do."

  She spurned the fruits that he had offered,
  And in their stead to him she proffered
  Confectionery sweet and good
  That she had brought into the wood.

  She gave him fragrant garlands too,
  And brilliant garments, clean and new;
  She offered wine; and while he quaffed,
  She played and swayed and danced and laughed.

  She played about him with a ball,
  And oft coquettishly would fall
  Upon his bosom, until he
  Took fire from her immodesty.

  At last she saw the deed was done,
  That she had charmed the hermit's son;
  And, gazing o'er her shoulder, fled,
  To make her sacrifice, she said.

  When she had left him, peace and joy
  Departed from the luckless boy;
  Sadly he sighed, by love distressed,
  An aching void within his breast.

  His father, while he sighed, returned,
  Whose eyes with fire ascetic burned,
  Whose life was one devoted prayer,
  Whose nails were overgrown with hair.

  When he beheld his son distressed
  With eye upturned and heaving breast,
  With longing written on his face
  And passion in contentment's place,

  "What troubles you, my dearest son?"
  He asked, "and are your duties done?
  Who has been here with you today?"
  And Deer-horn answered him straightway.

      III
  "A hermit youth with hanging hair,
  Not short, nor very tall, but fair
  And bright as gold, with lotus-eyes,
  Some child of heaven, wondrous wise.

  "He came in beauty like the sun,
  Black eyes, sweet voice, his hair undone
  And hanging soft, dark, fragrant, and
  Encircled by a golden band.

  "A relic on his neck was seen
  That danced like flashing lightnings keen;
  Below it, two soft swellings white
  That thrilled me with a strange delight.

  "Large hips he had, but slender waist
  Which I could see was close embraced
  By a golden belt; I saw it shine
  And it was not at all like mine.

  "And on his ankles something stirred
  That jingled like a cooing bird,
  While on his wrist there tinkled free
  A novel kind of rosary.

  "And as he moved, the beads would sing
  Like gay flamingoes in the spring;
  His pious robe was wondrous fair,
  And quite unlike the garb we wear.

  "His face was beautiful to see;
  His speech was kind and gladdened me;
  His voice was like the nightingale;
  It made me sigh and yearn and pale.

  "And as in spring the forest trees
  Wave beautifully in the breeze,
  So, father, when the wind blew, he
  Shed fragrance like a flowering tree.

  "His hermit locks— I wondered how
  They parted on his noble brow;
  And dangling from each ear, there stirred
  And danced what seemed a brilliant bird.

  "A round, elastic fruit he had
  That bounded from the earth like mad
  When he would strike it merrily—
  'Twas very wonderful to see.

  "He moved and swayed with graceful ease—
  I thought of wind among the trees:
  A wonderful delight and joy
  Came when I saw the godlike boy.

  "He held me in a tight embrace;
  I felt his hair; he pressed his face
  Against my face and made a noise
  That waked in me the strangest joys.

  "Our simple fruits he did not think
  Were good, or water that we drink;
  He gave me other fruits and rare,
  And said: 'This is my humble fare:

  "They were not like the fruits we eat,
  But tasted wonderfully sweet;
  They had a different sort of skin,
  And different was the pulp within.

  "A strange, sweet kind of water he
  Offered with noble piety;
  It filled me with an odd delight,
  And earth grew wobbly to my sight.

  "Sweet garlands with a careless mirth
  He wove, and scattered on the earth;
  Then, glorious as an ancient sage,
  Departed to his hermitage.

  "And since he went, I feel distressed;
  My limbs are burning and my breast;
  I long to go to him today
  Or have him here with me alway.

  "Yes, I will tread the path he trod
  And learn the way he worships God;
  With him I long to make a trial
  Of holy life and self-denial.

  "I find no peace from him apart;
  Religious yearnings fill my heart."

      IV
  "It was a devil, dear my son;
  By foes like these we are undone;
  They walk the earth in conquering charm
  And work religious men much harm.

  "They win us with their cunning wiles,
  Their wondrous beauty and their smiles,
  Then show themselves as demons fell
  And plunge us in the pit of hell.

  "The man who seeks religious peace
  Should keep himself from such as these;
  To ruin us is their delight,
  My pious boy. Forget the sight.

  "And those sweet waters that you had
  Are tasted only by the bad;
  And we ascetics never wear
  A perfumed garland on our hair.

  "Resist the devil, boy"; he said
  And then he hunted for the jade;
  Three days he sought without success
  And ceased for very weariness.

  Meantime, the tempting minx returned,
  And seeing her, young Deer-horn burned;
  "Come quick;" he said, "and let us roam;
  You see my father's not at home.

  "Your hermitage I fain would view";
  So, hand in eager hand, they flew
  And found a boat and floated down
  The river to the royal town.

  No sooner did the hermit gain
  The royal palace than the rain
  Fell, drenching every thirsty part
  And gladdening the sovereign's heart.

  The joyful monarch to the brave,
  Bewildered young ascetic gave—
  Lest he should ever seek release—
  A princess—and her name was Peace.

  YAYATI'S SONG

  Desire is never satisfied
    By winning each desire;
  As fuel, added to the blaze,
    Gluts not the hungry fire.

  Not all the barley in the world
    And rice and gold and kine
  And women, are enough for one—
    Remember, and resign.

  For when our longings and our sins
    Toward every creature cease,
  When deed and thought and word are pure,
    We find eternal peace.

  When all things lose their fear of us,
    And when we find release
  From fear of them, and hate, and hope,
    We have eternal peace.

  THE INTELLIGENT CORPSE

  A beggar in the graveyard cried:
  "Awake, my friend, be satisfied
  To live again and bear the weight
  Of poverty; for I of late
  Am weary grown; my heart is led
  To crave the comfort of the dead."
  The corpse was silent; he was sure
  'Twas better to be dead than poor.

  WISDOM'S SOUP

  A scholar who can merely quote
  Unmastered learning got by rate,
  Is erudition's luckless dupe,
  A spoon to ladle wisdom's soup.

  The fool who hears but cannot prize
  The wisdom of the truly wise,
  He too is erudition's dupe,
  A spoon to ladle wisdom's soup.

  But you, dear reader. if you prize
  This wisdom of the truly wise,

  Of tongues that relish wisdom's soup.

  JOY SUPREME

  Forget society and clothes and food;
    Seek thou that knowledge sure
  Which makes imperial power that men think good,
    Insipid and impure.
  There is a higher joy, eternal, free—
    Self-knowledge is its name—
  Whose taste makes universal sovereignty
    And such-like joys seem tame.

  HOW TO LIVE HAPPILY ON NOTHING A YEAR

  Imagine that what is
    Does not exist at all;
  Then will you not be grieved,
    However low you fall.

  Your deeds of yesterday
    And those that went before
  Are past and gone; for them
    You need not sorrow more.

  What was, no longer is;
    What was not, will not be:
  The past need bring regret
    To none from blindness free.

  Where is your father now?
    Where may his father be?
  You do not see their life;
    Your life they do not see.

  And you, O King, and I,
    With every foe and friend,
  Will surely cease to be,
    Since all things have an end.

  The men of twenty years,
    Or thirty years, or more,
  Will all be dead when once
    A hundred years are o'er.

  And even should riches cling
    To you, do not repine,
  But seek for comfort in
    The thought, "They are not mine."

  If man leave not his wealth,
    Then wealth the man will leave,
  Since this is surely so,
    Why should the prudent grieve?

  And poor men live today
    Who calm a nation's fears
  By wisdom and by strength,
    Your betters or your peers.

  They do not grieve like you;
    Then cease to grieve at length;
  Surpass or equal them
    In wisdom and in strength.

  Consider what the past
    And what the future teach,
  Not grieving at events,
    Indifferent to each.

  Desire the things you may,
    Not those you may not gain
  Enjoy the gifts of fate—
    Those lost deserve no pain.

  And he is surely fool
    Who curses God and weeps
  For what he had, and lost—
    Ingrate for what he keeps.

  And be not troubled if
    Men show unworthiness
  Of wealth they have; for thus
    Your sorrows grow no less.

  Endure though riches smile
    On all but you alone;
  For men of sense enjoy
    The wealth that others own.

  Yea, brave and righteous men
    In willing sacrifice
  Abandon wealth and home,
    Knowing salvation's price.

  Even kings a kingdom leave
    And count their loss a gain:
  In pain's extremity
    They seek the end of pain.

  From such men learn to find
    In penury, relief:
  Grief often comes as joy;
    Joy wears the form of grief.

  Nay, who would set his heart
    On gold that ends as dross,
  On life that ends as death,
    On love that ends as loss?

  The pole-tusked elephant
    Is like the sage; for he
  Lives lonely in the woods,
    Gladly, and frugally

  THE LAZY CAMEL

  There was a camel once who prayed
  To Brahma fervently. He said:
  "O Brahma, if your lordship please,
  I wish to browse with greater ease.

  "I pray you make my neck to grow
  Longer, a hundred miles or so."
  "So be it," said the god. And he
  Regained his forest, filled with glee.

  From stupid pride at Brahma's grace
  He sank in laziness apace.
  He would not stir a foot to find
  His provender. Fate made him blind.

  One day he stretched his neck to eat
  A hundred miles from legs and feet,
  And browsed in comfort and repose
  Until a mighty windstorm rose.

  While freezing rain began to fall
  On living things, and drenched them all,
  The creature stored his neck and head
  Upon a cavern's sheltered bed.

  Just then a jackal with his wife
  Entered the cave to save his life
  From chilling cold and pelting rain,
  Starvation, and exhausting pain.

  Starving, fatigued, and furthermore
  By nature's law a carnivore,
  The jackal started in to eat
  The camel's neck, as being meat.

  But when the wretched creature knew
  His neck was being eaten through,
  He frantically used his strength
  To shrink the neck to lesser length.

  Yet while he tossed the neck about,
  Upward and downward, in and out,
  The starving jackal calmly ate—
  The wife was not behind her mate.

  At last the jackal and his wife
  By eating took the camel's life,
  And when the wind and rain were gone,
  They left the cave and wandered on.

  The camel died in consequence
  Of foolish pride and indolence.
  Behold how evil follows hard
  On laziness, as its reward.

  THE WAY OF PEACE

  In shifting joy and grief
    Should I rejoice, repine,
  I should despise the soul
    That I must still call mine.

  Because this life, this world
    Are other men's no less
  Than they are mine, I win
    An end to all distress.

  As log meets log upon
    The sea, and parts again,
  So kinsman, friend, and son
    Love and abandon men.

  Grief starts and ends as joy;
    Joy starts and ends as grief
  The wheel, while whirling, finds
    Antipodal relief.

  With countless bonds of love
    Men cling to objects, and
  Assailed by failure's waves,
    Collapse like banks of sand.

  To him with foe, with friend,
    Him lacking friend, or foe,
  To wise or fool, comes joy,
    If fate will have it so.

  To hero, sage, and coward,
    To poet, dullard, fool,
  To weak and strong, comes joy
    By no discovered rule.

  To him who drinks her milk—
    Obtained no matter how—
  Calf, herdsman, king, or thief,
    A cow is still a cow.

  The dullest wights on earth
    Live joyfully; and so
  Do men supremely wise—
    The rest are sunk in woe.

  For brave men love extremes,
    Never the prudent mean;
  Extremes, they say, are joy;
    And grief, what lies between.

  The dunce sleeps joyfully,
    Setting his deeds aside,
  Wrapped in his foolishness
    As in a blanket wide.

  The man supremely wise,
    Past opposites, and all
  Mean envy, sees unmoved
    What good or ill befall,

  While men not wholly fools,
    Yet something less than wise,
  Are boisterous in success
    And writhe when fortune flies.

  The fool is always gay
    As angels are in heaven,
  Glad in his self-conceit,
   That gift by folly given.

  Joy ends in sloth—and grief;
    Grief ends in skill—and joy.
  And fortune dwells with skill,
    To sloth is ever coy.

  Then greet whatever comes
    Of joy or grievous smart,
  Delight or pain, with brave,
    Unconquerable heart.

  A thousand sorrows and
    A hundred fears assail
  The fool from day to day.
    The wise man does not quail.

  For sorrow cannot touch
    The truly modest soul,
  Long-suffering, peaceful, wise,
    Rooted in self-control.

  If your own limb should be
    The seat of sorrow, doubt,
  Wrath, or timidity,
    Cut roots, and cast it out.

  Desires, departing, leave
    A void. Joy fills it higher.
  But he who will pursue
    Must perish by desire.

  All heart's desires of earth
    And heaven's great bliss fulfilled
  Form one-sixteenth the joy
    That comes from passion stilled.

  This wisdom clasp. Faint not
    Upon the righteous path.
  Scorn all desires of sense,
    And put behind you wrath.

  For love is death that lives
    And feeds within the heart:
  And anger lives until
    The soul and body part.

  As turtles pull inside
    Their shells, pull free from sin:
  For glory, light, and peace
    Are only found within.

  Whatever deeds are done
    By one who thinks “'Tis mine,”
  Slope downward through remorse
    To death, in sure decline.

  When none has fear of you,
    And when you find release
  From fear and hate and hope,
    You have eternal peace.

  Leave true and false behind;
    Sorrow and glee control,
  Pain. pleasure, safety, fear—
    Find rest unto your soul.

  Be brave! Let sinful word
    And thought and action cease
  Toward every living thing—
    So find eternal peace.

  Passion-the fatal taint,
    The fool's enticing toy,
  Still young in aged hearts—
    Abandon. This is joy.

  THE JACKAL'S PRAYER

  Oh, thrice and four times blest are they
    Who have a pair of hands!
  I lift a fruitless prayer to heaven
    In envious demands.

  I cannot pull a sliver out
    Because I have no hands,
  Nor nab the lowly parasite
    Where sting or nipper lands.

  While those to whom a kindly god
    Gave two five-fingered hands
  Can catch a bug on any limb
    And smash him where he stands.

  They get them beds and dress and food
    And shelter with their hands;
  They build a house no frost or heat
    Or wind or rain disbands.

  And they bestride the lesser world
    With all-contriving hands:
  They make the bullock pull the cart
    In fear of reprimands.

  Yes,all the rest of us on earth
    Must follow their commands;
  For we are poor but honest folk,
    And weak. We have no hands.

  Thank God you are not classified
    By bug or jackal brands,
  Or mouse, or snake, or frog, or such.
  Thank Heaven, man, for hands!

  WISDOM OF BALI

  I notice Time destroying all
    The creatures in his path;
  If 'twere not so, I should indulge
    In joy and pride and wrath,

  You see me living as an ass
    In lonely stall forlorn,
  Devouring husks. And seeing this,
    You chuckle, filled with scorn.

  And if I would, I could assume
    Some form so terrifying
  That you, beholding it, would soon
    Be seen in terror flying.

  If heaven's king in armor stood
    Here in a gleaming mist,
  I could, if Time commanded, smite
    Him low with naked fist,

  But this is not a time for fight;
    This is a time for peace:
  Time causes every action; Time
    Bids every action cease.

  I understand the ancient laws
    By which events unroll—
  You too may understand. But first
    Make friends with your own soul.

  MEDHAVIN'S WISDOM

  He plucks a blossom here and there,
  His thoughts directed otherwhere;
  Before he sees desire or plan
  Complete, Death comes upon a man.

  Tomorrow's duty do today;
  Let not the evening's task delay
  Till evening hours. Death will not stay
  To ask if it be done or nay.

  Work out salvation. Do not wait;
  Lest Death your thought anticipate.
  Who knows the hour? or who can say
  Whose fatal moment comes today?

  Regardless of his settled plan,
  Death seizes on the helpless man.
  Then let your youth be given all
  To virtue. Life is whimsical.

  THE YOGA PATH

  For as a steersman guides a ship,
    Holding the tiller down,
  Who, leaving stormy seas behind,
    Sails to a lordly town,

  Just so the wise and earnest man
    May guide his soul, and find
  A far, high place of perfect peace,
    The body left behind.

  Or as a careful driver yokes
    Good horses to his car
  And quickly drives an archer to
    The spot desired, though far;

  As arrows hit the target, when
    The bowstring gives release.
  Just so the saint, with centered thought,
    Soon reaches perfect peace.

  Yes,but the learned Brahman knows
    How hard that path may be,
  And no man, so the wise declare,
    Can tread it easily.

  For just as in a lonely wood
    That creeps and crawls with snakes,
  Where pitfalls yawn and water fails,
    Tangled, with thorny brakes,

  A wild and foodless wood whose trunks
    Are gnawed by forest fire,
  A youth may seek, where robbers hide,
    The path of his desire,

  So may a Brahman find and tread
    The Yoga path. Yet he
  May quickly lose his footing there,
    Sa many snares there be.

  To stand on whetted razor-blades
    Is easy. Not a soul
  May stand upon the Yoga path
    Who lacks in self-control.
