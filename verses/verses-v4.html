  She whom I worship night and day, she loathes my very sight,
  And on my neighbour dotes, who in another takes delight;
  A third she in my humble self nothing but good can see:
  Now out upon the god of love, and him, and them, and me!

More:
  Now judge ye! — For a girl I walked forlorn
  Who laughed my vows to scorn;
  She loved another, who in coin repaid
  Wooing a second maid.

  And she, this second, making all complete,
  Would worship at my feet.—
  Four pretty fools and Kama with his malice
  Thus drove me from my palace.

  WOMEN'S EYES

  The world is full of women's eyes,
  Defiant, filled with shy surprise,

  The moonbeams that by day depart;
  The maid whose youthful beauty flies;
  The pool wherein the lotus dies;

Miller:
  The moon paled by day,
  An amorous lady with lost youth,
  A lake without lotuses,
  The dumb face of a handsome man,
  A prince obsessed with wealth,

  A villain come to the court of a king—
  Seven barbs in my heart.

  Where patience dwells what need of other shield?
  Why prate of foemen when to wrath we yield?
    More warmth our kindred give than fires; and friends
  Far more than soothing herbs our wounds have healed.

  Of kings add splendor to the poet's thought?

  THE DIVINE DECREE
  Thy wise creator wrote upon thy brow,
    When thou wast born, what wealth should once be thine;
  The sum was great perhaps, or small; yet now
    Thy fate is fixed, and sure the law divine.

  For if thou dwell within the desert's bound,
    Thou shalt have nothing less than his decree;
  Nor shall a single penny more be found,

  Ah, then be brave and play the manly part,
  Nor be so fond to humble thy proud heart

We do not fear a single thing

"For relatives are selfish, mean,

We understand what we have seen;

MANU AND THE FISH

I
There was a gentle, holy sage
Named Manu, in a former age.
The woes of life he would not blink;
For many years he did not wink.

With ragged clothes and frowsy hair
He lived beside a stream. And there
He saw a fish who thus began
To speak to him. "0 holy man,

"I am a little fish, you see;
And bigger fishes frighten me.
For bigger fishes eat the small;
It is their nature, once for all.

"So dreadful terror weighs me down;
Besides, I fear that I shall drown.
Then save me. Some day I will do
An equal favor, sir, to you:"

II
So Manu, when he heard his wish,
Stretched forth a hand, and took the fish,
And dropped him in a water-jar
That was as bright as moonbeams are.

And in the jar the little fish
Had everything his heart could wish.
He grew and thrived on food and fun,
For Manu loved him like a son.

At last he grew too big by far
To live within the water-jar.
He said: "Good Manu, I would thank
You very kindly for a tank."

So Manu took him to a tank
Eight miles in breadth from bank to bank,
And twice as long. There, free from fears,
He lived and grew for many years.

III
And when he grew too big to play
There in a comfortable way,
He said to Manu: "Pray deliver,
And put me in the Ganges River.

"And I will never show you spite,
But some day help you, as is right.
My growth has not been selfish; it
Has happened for your benefit:"

Kind Manu, anxious to deliver
His friend, went to the Ganges River,
And left him happy. As before
He grew in time a little more.

And then he said to Manu: "Dear,
I can no longer wiggle here.
My holy friend, be good to me,
And take me quickly to the sea:"

So Manu took him tenderly
And traveled quickly to the sea.
The fish tried not to weigh too much,
And to be nice to smell and touch.

IV
The fish, when he had reached the ocean,
Smiled at his holy friend's devotion,
And said: "O kind and holy man,
You do as much as fathers can.

"And now 'tis time for me to do
A little something, dear, for you.
For you must know, my holy friend,
The world is hastening to its end.

"A dreadful time is near at hand
For all the things that move or stand;
There comes a flood that has no bound,
And everybody will be drowned.

"So build a ship and build it strong:
Put ropes on board both stout and long.
And one thing further you will need,
Neat packages of every seed.

"Embark then with the seven seers,
And wait, good Manu, free from fears,
Until I come. And you will see
A horn upon the head of me.

"Till then, farewell. Do not delay.
The danger grows from day to day:"

v
Then Manu packed most carefully
The seeds, and straightway put to sea.
His good ship gently rose and fell
Upon the ocean's mighty swell.

He longed to see the friendly fish,
Who came in answer to the wish.
He seemed a floating mountain dread;
A horn was growing on his head.

So Manu, feeling less forlorn,
Fastened a rope about the horn,
And felt the ship glide speedily
Over the dancing, salty sea.

But when the wind began to roar
And ocean thundered more and more,
The tossing, shaken ship began
To stagger like a drunken man.

No land remained to cheer them there,
But only water, sky, and air;
No life through all those many years
Save Manu, fish, and seven seers.

But Manu, all those many years,
Went sailing with the seven seers;
The fish pulled on with might and main
And did not weary nor complain.

At last he did, however, stop
Beside the highest mountain-top,
And bade them tie the ship; and they
Call it Ship Mountain to this day.

VI
And then, with wide, unwinking eyes,
The fish, to Manu's great surprise,
Declared: "I saved the seven seers
From death and agonizing fears;

"For I am Brahma. And my friend,
Kind Manu, who has seen the end
Of all the world, shall make again
Gods, devils, animals, and men:'

And so he disappeared. But they,
Amazed, departed on their way,
While kindly Manu made again
Gods, devils, animals, and men.

Now all have heard who had the wish
The tale of Manu and the fish.
And everyone who takes it in,
Shall be forever free from sin.

THOUGHTS ON HAVING ONE'S WIFE
      STOLEN BY A GIANT

From the _Ramayana_. This is the lament of the hero Rama, when
his wife Sita is carried away by Ravan, the giant king of Ceylon.

They say that as the seasons move,
  Our sorrow gently fades away;
But I am far from her I love
  And sorrow deepens every day.

That she is gone, is not my woe;
  That she was reft, is not my pain;
The thought that agonizes so
  Is this; her youth is spent in vain.

Blow, breezes, blow to her dear face;
  Blow back to me her kisses sweet:
Through you we taste a glad embrace,
  And in the moon our glances meet.

When she was torn away from me,
  "My lord! My love!" was all her cry,
Which tortures me incessantly;
  My heart is poisoned, and I die.

I burn upon an awful pyre;
  My body wastes by day and night;
Her loss is fuel to feed the fire
  That burns so pitilessly white.

If I could leave each loving friend,
  Could sink beneath the sea, and sleep,
Perhaps the fire of love would end,
  If I could slumber in the deep.

One thought consoles my worst distress;
  Through this I live: I cannot die
While she lies down in loveliness
  Upon the selfsame earth as I.

The sun-parched rice, no longer wet,
  Lives on, while earth her moisture gives;
The root of love supports me yet,
  For they have told me that she lives.

Though giants hem her round, yet soon
  She shall be freed, and shall arise
As radiantly as the moon
  From clouds that darken autumn skies.

When shall I pierce the giant's breast
  With shafts that suck his life away,
That give my tortured darling rest
  And all her absent griefs allay?

When shall I feel the close embrace
  Of my good goddess, as in dreams?
When kiss her smile, while on her face
  The water born of gladness gleams?

When shall I pluck from out my heart—
  A heart by woes of absence torn—
The pain of life from love apart,
  Forget it, like a garment worn?

POT-EAR'S AWAKENING

From the Ramayana. When the giant citadel in Ceylon was invested
by Rama and his army, the giant king determined to call to his
assistance his most redoubtable subject, Pot-ear. The giant was normally
awake only one day every six months. He must therefore be awakened
before he can employ his great strength and courage in the giant
cause.

I
They started forth, the giant band
Obedient to their king's command,
With flesh and blood as tempting food,
With wreaths and perfumes, sweet and good.

And so they came to Pot-ear's door,
Where stretched the cave a league and more
On every side, where blossoms sweet
Poured fragrance forth, a guest to greet.

And all that mighty giant band
Before his snoring scarce could stand;
They tottered, but with spirit brave
They fought their way into the cave.

There Pot-ear stretched this way and that
Just like a mountain tumbled flat,
Hideous in his slumber deep,
For he was very sound asleep.

They saw him bristle, saw him shake;
They heard him hissing like a snake;
They felt his breathing like a storm
That blew them from his ugly form.

They saw his nostrils sink and swell,
His throat that yawned like gates of hell;
The dreadful, sprawling form they saw
That smelt of dinners eaten raw.

They made a mountain of the food
That they had brought, so sweet and good;
Beside his bed the mountain rose
Of deer and boars and buffaloes.

They grasped their trumpets glittering bright
As moonbeams shining in the night;
Impatiently they blew and blew,
And screamed and howled and shouted, too.

Through all the tumult loud and deep
Pot-ear lay snoring, fast asleep;
They saw he did not mind their clamor
And seized a stone, or club, or hammer.

They tumbled boulders on his chest,
To see if they could break his rest.
They beat a hundred rub-a-dubs
With fists and hammers, bars and clubs.

The only answer was a snore
A little deeper than before
That blew away the giant band;
Before his breath that could not stand.

More sternly yet the giants strove:
With sticks and whips and goads they drove
Horses and elephants abreast, Asses
and camels on his chest.

They dubbed and pounded without pity,
Until the tumult filled the city;
They made the woods and mountains shake,
But giant Pot-ear would not wake.

Then anger filled each giant breast;
They swore that they would break his rest.
One last attack they made at length
With all their might and wrath and strength.

And there were some to beat the drum,
While screamed and howled and shouted some;
Some bit his ears, while some would tear
Away great handfuls of his hair.

A hundred water-pots they poured
Into his ears, and still he snored;
They could not shake his slumber deep;
Pot-ear was very sound asleep.

Some took a hammer or a club,
With all their might began to drub
Upon his chest and limbs and head
To wake him from his drowsy bed.

They tied great, spiky stones to ropes
And dragged them over him; their hopes
Were disappointed still; for he
Slept on with peaceful dignity.

But when a thousand elephants
Upon his chest began to dance,
Then Pot-ear, gently tickled, broke
From bonds of slumber, and awoke.

He did not heed the falling stones
Or dubs that rattled on his bones,
But yawned and raised himself to see
What breakfast might provided be.

The giants pointed to the food
That they had brought, so sweet and good;
Then Pot-ear in his might arose
And ate some boars and buffaloes.

II
Now when the meat, with wine afloat,
Had vanished down his mighty throat,
Dull Pot-ear shook his heavy head,
And rolled his sleepy eyes, and said:

"Great matters surely are at stake,
Or I should hardly be awake;
And for our giant king, I will
Cool fire or overturn a hill.

"But tell me why I am awake;
Surely great matters are at stake."
Then giant Post-eye bent him low
And humbly answered: "Pot-ear, know

"That neither gods nor devils can
Affright us—but we fear a man.
He leads his mountainous apes across
The strait, for grief at Sita's loss.

"One ape has burned our splendid town
And he has struck Prince Aksha down.
While Ravan, heaven's scourge and thorn,
Has been by Rama overborne

"In single fight, and has been spared—
A thing no god or devil dared:"
Then Pot-ear rolled his eyes, and said:
"Well, I will strike the monkeys dead,

"With Lakshmana and Rama, and
Before our king as victor stand.
And monkey flesh and blood shall be
Your food—the blood of men for me:"

But when he heard this boasting grim,
The giant Great-paunch answered him:

"Nay, first consider everything,
And listen humbly to the king:
And after that, it will be right
To meet your enemy, and fight:"

So Pot-ear, rising. took a cup
And drank, to keep his courage up;
He drank two thousand jars of wine,
And washed his face, and made it shine.

Eager, excited, haughty, proud,
He towered above the giant crowd;
And as he strode his king to greet,
Earth trembled underneath his feet.

III
On, to his brother's proud abode,
Half-drunk with sleep and wine, he strode;
Red-eyed with wrath, he bowed him low,
And asked, "Why was I wakened so?

"What danger threatens, or what ill?
Whom would you like to have me kill?"
And Ravan, maddened by his wrong.
Said: "Brother, you have slept too long;

"So all the wickedness and woe
That Rama works, you do not know;
How he has built a bridge, and crossed
The channel with a monkey host.

"Behold their strangely hideous shapes!
See Lanka's groves, one sea of apes!
They kill our bravest when we fight;
For who can conquer monkey might?

"Ah, brother, save your stricken nation,
Your king reduced to supplication;
You know I love you and adore you;
I know how devils flee before you.

"For there is none on earth so strong
As you, to right my grievous wrong;
Scatter and tear the monkey crowds
Like wind among the autumn clouds:'

IV
Then Pot-ear laughed aloud and said:
"Refusing, Ravan, to be led
By us and our united sense,
You suffer now the consequence.

"Whoever scorns a mighty foe,
Is certain to be stricken low;
Whoever fails to guard his own
High place, is quickly overthrown."

Then Ravan frowned, and in his grim,
Gigantic fashion, answered him:
"Enough of sermonizing! Hold,
Be silent; do as you are told.

"Although it might be true I had
Been headstrong, ill-advised, or mad,
You, as a younger brother, should
Forget, and turn the sin to good.

"So, if you have a warrior's might,
Or if you love your brother, fight!
Or if you would not, sulk apart
While trouble makes me sad at heart.

"He only is a friend indeed
Who aids his sinful friend in need,
Who indefatigably gives
A helping hand to relatives:"

V
Then Pot-ear felt his brother's woe,
And answered softly, soothing, slow:
"Forget your sorrow, 0 my king;
Take heart at my encouraging.

"Grieve not. Am I not here, to kill
The wretched man that thwarts your will?
And what I said, I said to prove
My sympathy and brother's love.

"In battle's forefront I will slay
Rama, and chase his apes away;
His severed head shall bring relief
And joy to you; to Sita, grief.

"The giants mourning for their slain
Shall soon forget their grief again;
For I will wipe their tears away
As joyfully I slay and slay.

"Then grieve not, brother mine, but send
Me forth, your toils and wars to end;
For none can stand before my face
With spear or arrow, sword or mace.

"Soon Rama and his brother shall
Be dead, with all inimical,
O King. to you—god, ape, or man;
I wish to kill them, and I can.

"Yes, I would drink the sea, eat fire,
Slay Death himself, should you desire;
Would crush the mountains, pierce the earth,
Smite sun and stars, to bring you mirth,

"And food to me. I sleep so long
And grow so hungry and so strong
That earth and heaven and hell would be
A not too bounteous meal for me.

"Rejoice, and let your heart incline
To every pleasure rare and fine,
And murmur, as you sip your wine:
'Sita is mine, forever mine.'"

VI
But giant Great-paunch counseled so:
"He likes to talk, but does not know
The right and wrong, this vulgar whelp;
King Ravan is our only help.

"Recall the havoc in our clan
That Rama wrought in Janasthan;
The angry lion would you wake,
Or irritate the sleeping snake?"

To Ravan turning then, he said:
"Sita you seized and hither led
Her; now subdue her to your will,
If you desire her beauty still.

"And listen to my plan, wherethrough
She may bemade to favor you—
Proclaim in every street today
That heroes five go forth to slay

"Prince Rama—Pot-ear, Cleaver, and
Fork-tongue, Roarer, I who stand
Before you. We will bravely fight,
Struggling with all our main and might.

"And if we conquer, well and good;
At worst, we shall be dripping blood
When we return and say that we
Devoured your bitter enemy.

"And then proclaim throughout the town
That Rama has been stricken down
With Lakshman and the monkey host;
And give to them you honor most

"Garlands and slaves and such rewards
As your rich treasury affords.
Then, when the rumor has been spread
Of Rama and his army dead,

"Go, comfort Sita, speak her fair,
And give her jewels to deck her hair.
Her grief, combined with your deceit,
Will lay her grateful at your feet.

"She is a woman, helpless, bred
To ease; and if her lord is dead,
Or dead to her, she can but wive
With you, a lord to her alive."

VII
Then Pot-ear answered: "I will slay
Rama, and wipe your fear away;
When heroes promise you a wonder,
Their boasting is no empty thunder.

"While cowards and flatterers like you
Make ill anticipation true,
I fight, to win revenge again
For treasure lost and giants slain:'

Then Ravan laughed aloud and said:
"I fancy Great-paunch is afraid;
Go forth, brave Pot-ear, fight, and save
My honor: you alone are brave.

"And when they see your awful shape,
Terror will seize on every ape;
And Rama's heart and Lakshman's too
Will split with dread on seeing you."

So Ravan, knowing Pot-ear's might,
Rejoiced, and felt his heart grow light;
While Pot-ear grasped, his foe to strike,
His trusty, gold-bespangled pike—

The pike that gods and devils feared,
Made of black iron, in spots besmeared
With many a stain and blotch of red,
By foemen's blood contributed.

Then, maddened by the reek of blood,
To the great city wall he strode,
While flowers and prayers upon him fell,
And drums and trumpets wished him well.

And there he paused and spoke: "Today
Shall all the monkeys fade away
Like moths in flame. I would not care
To hunt them in their forest lair;

"Indeed, the species often proves
Quite ornamental in our groves;
But Rama is the cause of all
Our woe; so he and his must fall."

He spoke, nor heeded signs of ill
That waited on his footsteps still—
The sky as red as asses' skin,
The clouds with lightning mingled in,

The jackals spitting fire on high,
The throbbing arm, the twitching eye,
The vulture on his pikestaff croaking,
The thunderbolt before him smoking.

He heeded not, but leaped the wall,
Obeying thus the certain call
Of Death; and straight the monkey crowds
Scattered and fled like riven clouds.

But Angad called: "Why would you flee
Like apes of mean or no degree?
Return, and prove your valor; thus
He shall not prove a match for us:"

Ashamed, they seized upon great boulders
Or lifted trees upon their shoulders;
The trees were splintered, striking him;
Rocks split upon his every limb.

While underneath his blows they bled
And swooned and died, or turned and fled;
Till Angad called them back to fight,
Reproving thus their shameless flight:

"Why save your lives? Why run away
Like cowards? What will the women say?
For high-born monkeys may not flee
Like vulgar apes of no degree.

"And if we fight our best and die,
We win a hero's home on high;
If victory should crown our worth,
We win a hero's name on earth:"

"But life is dear to us,' they said,
"And Pot-ear quickly strikes us dead:"
Yet,rallying to their prince's name,
They fought once more for very shame.

VIII
They sought for courage in despair;
For wounds and death they did not care,
Nor for their scores and hundreds slain
And eaten on the battle-plain.

Then great Hanuman hurled a shower
Of boulders, using all his power;
But Pot-ear answered with a blow
From that fierce pike, that laid him low.

The mountain crag that Nila hurled
He caught, as through the air it whirled,
And powdered it, till sparks and flame
Forth from the tortured missile came.

Then monkeys by the thousand poured
Upon him, bit and tore and roared;
Even as they clawed and gashed and smote,
They vanished in their hell, his throat.

Even King Sugriva could not kill
His foe, nor Angad, struggling still;
Even Lakshman with an arrow-shower
Could not subdue his giant power.

"With Rama only will I fight;"
Cried Pot-ear: "then will put to flight,
When he is dead, your warriors all";
And Rama answered Pot-ear's call

With shafts that pierced his shaggy chest;
Then, spitting fire, with bleeding breast,
He charged, but from his weakened hand
The weapons dropped upon the sand.

Yet with bare, weakened hands he slew
Two hundred monkeys as they flew
Upon him; then, with tempest-shock
He hurled a craggy, ponderous rock

At Rama, who evaded it,
While Pot-ear, in a foaming fit,
Turned, licking bloody chops, and slew
Of monkey warriors not a few,

And hoarsely laughing, shouted so:
"Rama, I am no common foe
Like those that you have slain; this club
With which I have been wont to drub

"The gods and devils, you shall feel
As it prepares you for my meal:"
An answering arrow cut away
The right arm and the club: they lay

Immense: a second arrow sped
And shore away his bleeding head,
Which tumbled, grinning horribly,
Among the fishes in the sea.

Then choirs of heaven praised the might
Of Rama in that dreadful fight;
And monkey faces blossomed bright
Like lilies in the glad sunlight.

IX
But in the city Ravan kept
A tortured vigil, moaned, and wept:

"Ah, Pot-earl Source of all my hope and gladness!
  Where are you flown,
Leaving unplucked your brother's thorn of sadness,
  Dying alone?

"My right arm were you; you I trusted only,
  Death's match! And can
The tamer of high gods be sleeping lonely,
Slain by a man?

"The gods rejoice, forgetting all their anguish
  Foes not a few
Soon will assail the fortress where I languish
  Grieving for you.

"I am no king, nor Sita's lover longer—
  Till I shall give
Battle to Rama, prove myself the stronger,
  Vainly I live,

"And should it be his lot to slay another
  Gladly I die;
Beside the headless form that was my brother,
  There let me lie."

FORTITUDE

From the _Mahabharata_. This is the consolation offered
to who have lost kinsmen in the great epic war.

All gathering ends in dissipation;
  All heaps, at last, must fall;
All friendships melt in separation;
  And death at last ends all.

The coward dies, the hero lives
  A space, but none pass by
The appointed days that heaven gives—
  Then let us fighting die.

All lives begin from nothingness,
  Stir for a time, and then
(No cause for grief) sink into less
  Than nothingness again.

Death has no enemy nor friend;
  Each in his turn must pass,
Must helpless to that bidding bend
  As wind-blown blades of grass.

Our goal is—there. And every day
  The one long caravan
Moves on with death to point the way.
  Why should it grieve a man?

For all the saints and scholars old
  Since first the world began
Are gone, with every fighter bold.
  Why should it grieve a man?

The fighter slain attains to heaven;
  The other wins the fight;
To each is much advantage given;
  Fighting is good and right.

And God, who loves a fighting man,
  Hailing a welcome guest,
Prepares with all the care he can,
  A seat among the blest.

Oh, trust yourself, and spare your tears
  For those who fell in strife;
Not all your sorrow, pain, and fears
  Can bring the dead to life.

Hundreds of parents, sons, and wives
  Loved you with passion true;
Gone are the loves of former lives—
  What do they mean to you?

Time makes us win our strength, and keep;
  Time tells us when to die;
Time is awake when others sleep;
  Time passes no man by.

Youth vanishes. and beauty, wealth,
  And love and friendship die
With life itself and living health;
  But wise men do not cry.

They do not cry, but fight; and then
  Forget their former woes;
For pain forgotten is not pain,
  But pain remembered, grows.

This wisdom heals the heart's dull woes
  As herbs the body's pain;
When palliating wisdom grows,
  We are not children then.

One thing remains of all our loves,
  Our wealth and honors won—
The character that onward moves,
  The deeds that we have done.

Man has no enemy nor friend
  Except himself; alone
He knows what deeds to virtue tend,
  What seeds of sin are sown.

HYMN TO FAITH

By Faith the holy fire is lit,
  And sung the liturgy;
We pray to Faith with all our wit
  For prosperous piety.

Give wealth, O Faith, to me who give
  Such worship as I can;
Make me respected, make me live
  A rich, religious man.

The gods have faith from imps, I see;
 For what they will, they can;
Enlarge my prosperous piety
  As a rich, religious man.

Gods worship Faith, and pious men
  Must worship every hour;
If faith first fills our bosoms, then
  Faith gives us wealth and power.

We call on Faith by morning's light,
  On Faith in glare of day,
On Faith when evening sinks to night:

DRONA'S DEATH
From the _Mahabharata_. Drona is the eighty-year-old hero who had
instructed the heroes of both the opposing armies in the use of arms.

While Drona led the Kuru van,
The Pandu army to a man
Was beaten back and strove in vain
To dominate the battle-plain.

Where tramp and clash of battle grew
Like crackling flames in dry bamboo,
There Drona blazed, a smokeless fire
That fed on death and mounted higher.

Where aged Drana's arrows passed,
Horse, man, and tusker breathed their last.
Like hissing snakes his arrows sped
And left a trail of reeking red.

The Pandu army fought in vain
Against him. They had all been slain,
Had not they striven to beguile
Their foe with false and wicked wile.

For Bhima cried aloud and said:
"Old man, your son is stark and dead.

"As silly simpletons will fight
For wife and child and money bright,
So you have fought-and all for one,
Your dearly loved, your only son:

"Who studied in the school of strife,
And paid his lesson with his life.
Dead on the plain his body lies
A prey to all that creeps and flies."

The father heard the lie, and slow
His hand released the fatal bow;
He sank, yet roused himself again
In one strong cry: "Fight on, my men!

"Destroy the treacherous Pandu line,
But hope no more for aid of mine.
All hatred dies from out my breast;
Remains religion's peaceful rest."

His foe believed the Brahman's word
And darted with uplifted sword
To pierce him through, while all the men
And all the horses shrieked in pain.

But Drona, in ecstatic prayer,
Knew not his foe was standing there;
Wrapped in inviolable fire,
He thought on God with pure desire.

We saw his lifted face; we heard
His murmuring lips pronounce the word
"Amen!" We felt him pray; at last
We knew his hero soul had passed.

For while his body tumbled dead,
A flame flashed from his cloven head;
His soul flew in the flame above
To dwell with God in deathless love.

There were but five of mortal birth
Who saw his spirit leave the earth;
Who heard the choirs of angels sing
Divinely in their welcoming;

Saw heaven's everlasting fire
Flash out, and flicker, and expire;
And knew that he was with the saints
Where God's love wearies not nor faints.

But all could see the bloody corse,
By arrows torn and trampling horse;
All sorrowed for the evil done
Save one insatiate foe alone,

Who scorned our hero's eighty years
And scant hair gray behind the ears;
He hacked the body from the head,
To show his hatred for the dead.

And all the army fled away;
Where Drona died, they could not stay;
But Drona's spirit dwells on high
Among the stars that light the sky.

  Our days are fewer yet.

Our hearts are warm to each new spring,
  Each summer, winter, fall;
But what the passing seasons bring
  Is only Death to all.

As log collides with log upon
  The sea, and parts again,
So friend and gold and wife and son
  Love and abandon men.

As if a traveler should meet
  A hurrying caravan,   .
And say:"I too with willing feet
  Will follow as I can;"

So to the long parade we cleave
  That with the world began:
Then do not grieve, you cannot leave

  No river climbs the hill;

THE THIEF'S SONG
The _Chaura-panchashika_  of the poet Bilhana, who lived in Kashmir
in the eleventh century. The thief has stolen a princess' heart, and
has been thrown into prison, on the discovery of the intrigue, by the
irate father. While awaiting the king's pleasure, he writes his song,
which comes to the royal ear, procuring him liberty and the legitimation
of his love. The verbal trick of the translation is found also
in the Sanskrit.

As then she was, I think of her today:
  The face that blossomed as she woke from sleep,
The slender waist, the golden champaks gay,
  The self-surrendering love;   and I must  weep
  For magic happiness I could not keep.

If I could see her once again today,
  Fair as the moon, as beautifully pale,
Full-bosomed, love-sick, bearing queenly sway
  O'er youth and charm, that only would avail
  To heal my fever, and to make me hale.

If I could see her lotus-eyes today,
  The breast that into sloping shoulders slips,
Would I not clasp her in my arms straightway
  And drink the maddening honey of her lips,
  Drunk like the bee that from the lotus sips!

In prison I remember her today:
  Dark curls against the pallor of her cheek;
The soft resistance as she strove to stay
  My eager love with arms around my neck—
  Yet shamed, and even in her resisting, meek.

Awaiting death, I think of her today:
  Of her sweet face, her timid, downward glance,
Her eyes that in their restlessness betray
  The madness of love's long and waking trance—
  Queen-swan among love's flowering lily-plants!

If I could see her in my cell today,
  If arms that yearn for her could but receive her,
My best of love should comfort her, should slay
  The absence and the sorrows that bereave her,
  I'd close my eyes, and never, never leave her.

A vision comes to comfort me today,
  A slender form that gives to dance a grace
Unknown before with beauties that obey
  Love's bidding, and a pale but shining face,
  And earrings that in air strange patterns trace.

And I remember in my bonds today,
  How she, with soft, smooth sandal-powder sweet,
And musk diffusing pungent perfume, lay
  Upon her couch, how arching brows would greet
  Her lovely eyes, like lips that kissing meet.

Here, chained and fettered, I recall today,
  The slender form, eyes veiled in modest fear,
The wine-sweet lips I kissed in loving play,
  The musk, the saffron of my own Kashmir,
  Betel, and camphor, that to her were dear.

The crowning moment I recall today,
  When all her soul is given to my lips,
When, clad in love's warm, golden, glad army,
  My darling from the hated palace slips,
  Like to the moon delivered from eclipse.

But slighter joys are in my mind today,
  How once a lovers' quarrel checked our glee;
Then when I sneezed, the princess would not say
  "God bless you!" but with silent coquetry
  Stuck blossoms in her hair, to madden me.

Another picture visits me today:
  The drops of weariness that oft would seek
To make upon her face a pearl inlay
  When love had left her pale and worn and weak;
  The golden earring that would fret her cheek.

I seem to see her lovely breast today,
  The skirt that tripped her quick steps on the floor,
The glance that modesty would lead astray
  And love bring back to me, the lips grown sore
  Because I would be kissing evermore.

I seem to see my princess-bride today
  Moving with swanlike, undulating grace,
And in her hand a red ashoka-spray,
  Pearl necklace on her breast in close embrace,
  Quick smiles that light the pallor of her face.

I see her gold-bespangled dress today
  Held as a frail defending shield, the pain
Of my too eager passion to allay,
  Clutched tightly as she struggles once again
  For very shame to leave me—but in vain.

Her golden bracelets haunt my thoughts today,
  Her restless eyes that pierce a gloom like this
As memories that none can take away,
  The teeth of pearl, red lips, the secret bliss,
  The wealth of hair that fresh-picked blossoms kiss.

That wealth of hair I seem to see today
  When ribbons break and flowers begin to fall;
Then heaven is opened in the dazzling ray
  Of her dear smile; at love's imperious call
  We sink in bliss that none may share at all.

And I remember in my cell today
  How she would come to find me through the night.
Guided by beams illumining her way
  From lamps that glitter with a gemlike light
  On her shamed face, and mine with kindness bright.

Well I remember thee, my love, today:
  Thy startled eyes as of a gentle deer,
Thy body wasting at the least delay
  Of love, thy graceful gait, thy teeth so dear—
  Delights of heaven transplanted to Kashmir!

I hear the echo of thy laugh today:
  I see thy bosom quiver in sheer glee;
I see the necklace, darting beams that stray
  About thy neck; sure, Love has planted thee
  Upon a hill, his bright flower-flag to be!

Yes, I can hear through dungeon-walls today
  Sweet flatteries of thine, when, soon or late,
Passion grew weary in its house of clay;
  I hear the parrot quaintly imitate,
  Learning soft words to utter to her mate.

Even as in prison I recall today
  The limp, surrendered form, the luscious hair,
The half-shut eyes, the swanlike, queenly play
  In love's bright lotus-pool, I cannot bear,
  In death or life, to be without her there.

If I could see her once again today
  At sunset, see her fawnlike, gracious eyes,
If on her heavenly bosom I could lay
  My cheek and rest—oh, I should quite despise
  The saint, the king, the blest in Paradise.

For I remember fervently today
  Her beauty perfect in its every part,
To which all other lovely women pay
  Their homage, for 'tis far beyond their art—
  Queen of love's drama, mistress of my heart!

I could not, if I would, forget today
  Even for a moment, such a wondrous wife,
So young, so helpless that she seems to pray
  For pity, stabbed by love as by a knife,
  Nearer than garments are, more dear than life.

The vision of her beauty comes today
  To make all other beauty seem awry.
To shame the pride of women, and to slay
  Men's hearts by hundreds; and I know that I,
  Consumed by absent fires, shall surely die.

Heroic wisdom, teach me how today
  To act, to save a life than life more dear,
And deeds of heaven's heroes to outweigh;
  For well I know that death is creeping near,
  And for my bride, my brave, true bride, I fear.

My bride! And must I think of her today
  With bright eyes dimmed by sorrow and by fears,
With light feet treading slow the future gray;
  I hear her voice come stumblingly through tears,
  And see her bowed by woe through endless years.

For I have never seen, nor see today
  A face that with my darling's could compare,
Though all the rival world should challenge. Nay,
  The sweetness of Love's wife is not so rare;
  The moon itself is not so spotless fair.

Her wealth of wondrous hair I see today,
  Her teeth of pearl; and I remember well
How sorrow in her presence would not stay;
  How union with my bride would ever spell
  The bliss of heaven; one moment's absence, hell.

The last grim moment I recall today
  When from her palace slaves that seemed to be
Resistless slaves of Death, tore me away,
  And all her prayers for me were vain; yet she
  Still gazed and gazed. That gaze still tortures me.

I think with anguish of her face today—
  The face that in its beauty overbore
The wonder of the moon's unclouded ray—
  Because upon that face I may not pore
  Again, and yet again, and evermore.

I think of her, my hope of life, today,
  How she would listen with her mind and heart
To all I said. My maiden young and gay,
  Thy youth was mine alone, thine artless art,
  And shall be mine again, though death us part.

And I recall what I have lost today,
  How she would move in such sweet perfume clad
That bees would gather round her cheek alway;
  The very tinkle that her bracelets had
  When she would fix her hair, will drive me mad.

And I remember woefully today
  How gently I would waken her, while she
Would shiver, and her startled eyes would stray,
  Unable yet our love's new day to see—
  She wakes, starts back, then recognizes me.

And I recall another hour today
  When, jealous, she would leave me. I entreat
Her, and she does not turn her face away
  But weeps when kissed. I fall before her feet:
  "Be gracious to thine humble servant, sweet.

"Thou canst not think that I would fall today
  In thy bedchamber, victim to the glance
Of others, I, the subject of thy sway—
  Far rather would I perish in a trance
  Of thy dear kisses, playfulness, and dance."

I wonder, as I think of her today,
  If she be heaven's queen come down to earth,
Or Shiva's bride, or Vishnu's. Or she may
  Be God's own thought of beauty in mortal birth,
  To drive men mad with woman's perfect worth.

There is no man that lives on earth today
  Who could depict her; none but me has seen
Such beauty. Should the king of heaven essay
  The task, with memories of his heavenly queen,
  He might succeed. None other could, I ween.

And I remember in my cell today
  How she would stop her ears in graceful fun.
No other face like hers is lovely.
  Yea, And if her form blots out beneath the sun
  All other beauty, why, what harm is done?

No doubt her heavenly features keep today
  The pallid splendor of the autumn moon,
And trip the saint on his ascetic way:
  Would I might gain the glory lost so soon,
  And lose no more forever such a boon!

Ah, yes, if I might plunge again today
  Beneath love's waters that so long I miss,
Might save love's lotus-blossom from decay
  And share with her the heaven of a kiss,
  I'd give my life for one such moment's bliss!

Though lovely women walk the world today
  By tens of thousands, there is none so fair
In all that exhibition and display
  With her most perfect beauty to compare—
  This is my consolation, and my care.

As then she floated, so she floats today
  A swan-queen, down the river of my mind
O'er waves that thrill beneath her plumage gay;
  She leaves my admiration far behind,
  And flying dust of blossoms turns me blind.

In sadness I remember her today,
 The daughter of my king, whom love has driven
To me with timid, eager eyes—then say,
  Was she a goddess, or a nymph of heaven,
  Angel, or fairy, to my longings given?

I cannot for an hour forget today
  From dawn until the evening sinks in night
How, sleeping, she would gather beauty; nay,
  Her form seemed slenderer, her breast more white,
  Her gems more radiant yet, by morning's light.

Her golden beauty comes to me today,
  Her slow, coquettish grace, as she would lie
In shamed humility upon her couch, would pray
  For maddening love and kisses. Oh, might I
  Taste that elixir now, I could not die.

I could not die, might I enjoy today
  That bliss so deep as almost to be woe;
We hardly knew if it were war or play,
  So fiercely did we clasp each other, so
  Fire-hot with passion did our faces glow.

How could I, after that, endure today
  The subtlest fascinations of another?
Far rather would I end my life straightway;
  Come quickly, Death! Come as a kindly brother,
  With one swift act my spark of life to smother.

God Shiva has his poison even today;
  The ocean guards his awful, hidden fire;
The tortoise bears upon his back alway
  The burden of the earth. However dire
  The things they love, they keep what they desire.

DEAD LOVE

In early days, my husband, we
Vlere one unsevered entity,
And neither of the lovers knew
Were I the dearer half, or you.
Now you are tyrant of my life,
And I am nothing but your wife.
Oh, it was hard as stone for me,
The fruit of life's alluring tree!

HEAVEN ABOVE AND HEAVEN BELOW

Oh, dwell by Ganges' holy wave
Where passion's slave his soul may lave;
Or on the bosom of a girl
Where strings of pearl would charm a churl.

THE BAD SON

What profits the begetting of a son,
So he be neither good nor wise?
With sightless eyeballs what is to be done?
They ache and yet they are not eyes.

ENTER INTO THY CLOSET

Although thou sink to hell, fly through the air,
  Or flutter o'er the earth and never cease,
Think not, my soul, to find salvation there:
  Remember God at home, who gives thee peace.

TRY AGAIN

Do not despise yourself, my son,
  For early ill-success;
For things that were not, come to be,
  While things that are, grow less.

THE BLESSING OF SILENCE

The fool among the wise may shine
A moment, if his dress be fine;
But
One moment, while his mouth is shut.
