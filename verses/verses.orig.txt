# Women's Eyes

{
  WOMEN'S EYES

  The world is full of women's eyes,
  Defiant, filled with shy surprise,
  Demure, a little overfree,
  Or simply sparkling roguishly;
  It seems a gorgeous lily-bed,
  Whichever way I turn my head.
}
{
|| BharSt_2.4 ||
}
{
Miller:
  Lured here by curving beautiful brows,
  There by gestures of modesty,
  By quivering looks of alarm,
  By the graces of amorous play,
  By lovely faces and darting eyes;
  I am lured by signs of awakening maids
  And every direction seems strewn
  With lotuses blooming for dalliance.
}

{
  IF ONLY WE MIGHT DRESS IN AIR

  If only we might dress in air,
    And eat what begging brings,
  And sleep outdoors, we should not care
    For all the money-kings.
}

{
  LOVE IS YOUNG

  The wrinkles on my face are all untold;
    My hair is gray and thin;
  My limbs are sadly feeble grown, and old:
    But love is young, and sin.
}

{
  LOVE GROWS BY WHAT IT FEEDS ON

  When she is far, I only want to see see her;
    When she is seen, I only want to kiss her;
  When she is kissed, I never want to flee her;
    I know that I could never bear to miss her.
}

{
  GENTLE EYES

  Candle, and fire, and star,
    Sun, moon, to give me light;
  But her dear, gentle eyes are far—
    This world is night.
}
{
|| BharSt_2.14 ||
}
{
Miller:
  Beside a lamp or flaming hearth,
  In light of stars or sun or moon,
  Without her fawnlike eyes
  My world remains in darkness.
}

{
  THE STUBBORN FOOL-I

    A diamond you may draw
    From an alligator's jaw;
  You may cross the raging ocean like a pool;
    A cobra you may wear
    Like a blossom in your hair;
  But you never can convince a stubborn fool.
}
{
|| BharSt_1.4 ||
}
{
Tawney:
  Snatch a jewel, if it please you, from the tiger's ravening throat;
  Cross the ocean, though its billows toss in foamwreaths round your boat;
  Fearless twine an angry cobra like a garland round your head;
  But with fools forbear to argue,—better strive to wake the dead.
}

{
  THE STUBBORN FOOL-II

    With sufficient toil and travail
    You may gather oil from gravel;
  The mirage perhaps your thirsty lips may cool;
    If you seek it night and morn,
    You may find a rabbit's horn;
  But you never can convince a stubborn fool.
}
{
  labheta sikatāsu tailam api yatnataḥ pīḍayan
  pibec ca mṛga-tṛṣṇikāsu salilaṃ pipāsārditaḥ |
  kvacid api paryaṭan śaśa-viṣāṇam āsādayet
  na tu pratiniviṣṭa-mūrkha-cittam ārādhayet || BharSt_1.5 ||
}
{
Tawney:
  If you squeeze with might and main,
  Oil from sand you may obtain;
  If with parching thirst you burn,
  Some mirage may serve your turn;
  If you wander far and wide,
  Rabbits' horns may grace your side;
  But you'll never—trust my rule—
  Please a headstrong, bumptious fool.

More:
  Oil from the sand a man may strain,
  If chance he squeeze with might and main;
  The pilgrim at the magic well
  Of the mirage his desert thirst may quell.

  So traveling far a man by luck
  May find a hare horned like a buck; —
  But who by art may straighten out
  The crooked counsels of a stubborn lout?
}

{
  SEVEN ARROWS

  Seven arrows pierce my heart:
  The moonbeams that by day depart;
  The maid whose youthful beauty flies;
  The pool wherein the lotus dies;
  The handsome man whose lips are dumb
  The rich man, miserly and glum;
  The good man sunk in suffering;
  The rogue in favor with the king.
}
{
  śaśī divasa-dhūsaro galita-yauvanā kāminī
  saro vigata-vārijaṃ mukham anakṣaraṃ svākṛteḥ |
  prabhur dhana-parāyaṇaḥ satata-durgataḥ sajjano
  nṛpāṅgaṇa-gataḥ khalo manasi sapta śalyāni me || BharSt_1.56 ||
}
{
Tawney:
  The moon when dimmed by daylight, and a maid whose charms have fled,
  A lake with faded lotuses, a good man ill bested,
  A speechless mouth, a grasping king, a scoundrel in his train,
  Are seven thorns that fret my soul with neverending pain.

Miller:
  The moon paled by day,
  An amorous lady with lost youth,
  A lake without lotuses,
  The dumb face of a handsome man,
  A prince obsessed with wealth,
  A man of virtue ever wretched,
  A villain come to the court of a king—
  Seven barbs in my heart.
}


{
  SUBSTITUTES

  What need of armor to the patient soul?
  What need of foes, if temper spurns control?
  If rogues are near, what need of snakes to harm you?
  If relatives, what need of fire to warm you?
  If friends, what need of magic draughts for health?
  If blameless scholarship, what need of wealth?
  If modesty, what need of gems and flowers?
  If poetry, what need of kingly powers?
}
{
  kṣāntiś cet kavacena kiṃ kim aribhiḥ krodho 'sti ced dehināṃ

  vrīḍā cet kim u bhūṣaṇaiḥ sukavitā yady asti rājyena kim || BharSt_1.21 ||
}
{
Tawney:
  Better silence far than speaking,
  Worse are kinsmen oft than fire,
  There's no balm like friendly counsel,
  There's no enemy like ire,
  Rogues have keener teeth than vipers,
  Brains outweigh the miser's hoard,
  Better modesty than jewels,
  Tuneful lyre than kingly sword.

More:
  Where patience dwells what need of other shield?
  Why prate of foemen when to wrath we yield?
    More warmth our kindred give than fires; and friends
  Far more than soothing herbs our wounds have healed.

  Why pray the gods whose heaven by love is wrought?
  Why slave for wealth when wisdom is unbought?
    What pearls can modesty adorn? what gift
  Of kings add splendor to the poet's thought?
}

{
  SWEET AND BITTER

  Sweet are the moonbeams, sweet the grass-grown wood,
  Sweet is the peaceful converse of the good,
  The poet's song is sweet, the maiden's face
  When angry tear-drops lend a sudden grace:
  All would be sweet if human fate were fitter;
  The thought of death turns all the sweet to bitter.
}
{

}
{
Miller:
  Moonlight beams, a forest glade,
  The fellowship of friends,
  The legends told in poetry,
  All are enchanting.
  Enchanting too is her lovely face
  Gleaming with tears of anger;
  Enchanting if only your thought can forget
  Their ephemeral nature.
}

{
  WHEN I KNEW A LITILE BIT

  When I knew a little bit,
  Then my silly, blinded wit,
  Mad as elephants in rut,
  Thought it was omniscient; but
  When I learned a little more
  From the scholar's hoarded store,
  Madness' fever soon grew cool,
  And I knew I was a fool.
}

  tadā mūrkho 'smīti jvara iva mado me vyapagataḥ || BharSt_1.8 ||
}
{
Tawney:
  When but a little I had learned, in my own partial eyes
  I seemed a perfect Solon and immeasurably wise;
  But when a little higher I had climbed in wisdom's school,
  The fever-fit was over and I knew myself a fool.

{
  WHOM DOES SHE LOVE?

  With one she gossips full of art;
  Her glances with a second flirt;
  She holds another in her heart:
  Whom does she love enough to hurt?
}
{
}
{
More:
  With one they laugh and chatter, yet beguile
  With luring eyes a second;
  A third they cherish in their heart the while, -
  Their true love who hath reckoned?
}

{
  ARROWS OF LOVE

  Where are you going, winsome maid,
  Though deepest, darkest night? (he said.)
  I go to him whom love has made
  Dearer to me than life (she said).
  Ah, girl, and are you not afraid,
  For you are all alone? (he said.)
  The god of love shall be mine aid,
  Arrows of love fly true (she said).
}
{
  [Amaru]
}

{
  THE DANGER OF DELAY

  In giving, and receiving too,
  In every deed you have to do,
  Act quickly; if you wait a bit,
  Then time will suck the juice of it.
}
{
  [Hitopadesha]

{
BETTER TO DWELL IN MOUNTAINS WILD

Better to dwell in mountains wild
  With beasts of prey
Than in the palaces of gods
  With fools to stay.
}
{
  varaṃ parvata-durgeṣu
  bhrāntaṃ vanacaraiḥ saha
  na mūrkha-jana-samparkaḥ

}
{
Tawney:
  I'd sooner live in mountain caves with lions, bears, and apes,
  Than dwell in Indra's heavenly halls with brainless human shapes.

More:
  Better, I said, in trackless woods to roam
  With chattering apes or the dumb grazing herds,
  Than dwell with fools, though in a prince's home,
  And bear the dropping of their ceaseless words.
}

{
  THE APRIL WIND

  The wind of April is a lover bold:
  He makes the women shiver hot and cold;
  He shuts their eyes, he rumples up their hair,
  And catches rudely at the gowns they wear;
  Time after time he presses pretty lips
  From which a cry indignant-joyful slips.
}

{
  MY FOLLY'S DONE

  Why should that girl still use her keen,
  Coquettish eyes that steal the sheen
  From lotus-flowers. What can she mean?

  My folly's done. The fever-sting
  Of love's soft arrow does not cling;
  And yet she doesn't stop, poor thing!
}

{
  DOES SHE LOVE ME?

  Although she does not speak to me,
    She listens while I speak;
  Her eyes turn not, my face to see,
    But nothing else they seek.
}
{
  [Shakuntala]
}

{
  REMEDIES

  A fire with water we defeat,
  With parasols the midday heat,
  Mad elephants with goads that prick,
  Oxen and asses with a stick,
  Sickness with draughts that banish harm,
  Poison with many a spell and charm,
  Science has cures for every ill
  Except the fool; be prospers still.
}
{
|| BharSt_1.11 ||
}
{
Tawney:
  Water will serve to put out fire, umbrellas 'gainst the heat,
  A sharp hook guides the elephant, the ox and ass we beat,
  Disease we cure with doctor's stuff, the serpent's bite with charms,—
  Against the fool, the worst of ills, Nature provides no arms.
}

{
  THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE GOOD

  You are a teacher of the youth
  Who master philosophic truth;
  I seek in the poetic art
  What charms and ravishes the heart.
  Yet we are honest and we see
  The only good is charity;
  And nothing charms us, fools or wise,
  Except a maid with lotus-eyes.
}

{
  THE POWER OF MONEY

  His powers are still the same, his actions too,
  His mind is quite as keen, his speech as true;
  Yet he has undergone a wondrous change—
  He lost his money. Do you think it strange?
}

{
  DESIRE IS YOUNG

  Not time, but we, have passed away;
  Not virtue, we ourselves grow cold;
  Not joys, but we, no longer stay:
  Desire is young, but we are old.
}
{

}
{
Miller:
  We savored no pleasure,
  So we are consumed.
  We practiced no penance,
  So we are afflicted.
  We did not elude time,
  So we are pursued.
  We did not wither craving,
  So we are the wizened.
}

{
  THOU ART A FLOWER

  Thou art a flower whose fragrance none has tasted,
    A gem uncut by workman's tool,
  A branch no desecrating hands have wasted,
    A virgin forest, sweetly cool.

  No man on earth deserves to taste thy beauty,
    Thy blameless loveliness and worth,
  Unless he has fulfilled man's perfect duty—
  And is there such a one on earth?
}
{
  [Shakuntala]

{
  THE DIVINE DECREE
  Thy wise creator wrote upon thy brow,
    When thou wast born, what wealth should once be thine;
  The sum was great perhaps, or small; yet now
    Thy fate is fixed, and sure the law divine.

  For if thou dwell within the desert's bound,
    Thou shalt have nothing less than his decree;
  Nor shall a single penny more be found,
    Although the golden mount thy dwelling be.

  Ah, then be brave and play the manly part,
  Nor be so fond to humble thy proud heart
  And fawn before the rich with cringing art.

  For see! A jar that in the ocean fell
  Holds no more water in its little shell
  Than when you lowered it in the meanest well.

{
Miller:
  Whatever wealth, vast or scant, is traced
  On man's brow by Disposer Brahmā
  Will he win though he dwell on a barren desert,
  But no more on the golden mountain Meru.
  Be patient then! Do not sully yourself
  Before the rich with vile servility!
  Perceive that a jug draws its measure
  Of water from a well or from the sea.

  TWO KINGS

  Flee from the palace where they say:
  The king is sleeping; go away-
  He has no time for you today-
  Or-he will see you if you stay-
  He will be angry anyway.

  Flee to another, greater king,
  My soul, wbo rules each mortal thing,
  Whose palace knows no bolt, no ring,
  No porter's harsh. sarcastic fling,
  No pain, no human suffering.
}

{
  ABSENCE AND UNION

  Absence is union dear,
  When hearts are one;
  Union is absence drear.
  When love is done.
}

{
  THE SERPENT-WOMAN

  Avoid the poison-glance, my friends;
    The serpent-woman flee;
  Her crooked path has crooked ends;
    Her hood is coquetry.

  If you are stung by common snakes,
    Perhaps you will not die;
  If poison from a woman takes,
    The doctors say good-bye.
}

{
  CAN SHE BE DEAR?

  The thought of her is saddening,
    The sight of her is fear,
  The touch of her is maddening—
    Can she be really dear?
}
{
}
{
More:
  But to remember her my heart is sad,
  To see her is to know
  Bewildered thoughts, and touching driveth mad —
  How is she dear that worketh only woe?
}

{
  THE DECLINE OF TRUE LEARNING

  Once, learning slew the living woe
  Of wise men. That was long ago.
  She then disdained such service rare,
  Became a practical affair.
  But nowadays she sees that kings
  Despise all intellectual things,
  And sinking lower day by day,
  She seems to vanish quite away.
}

{
  THE LAST DAY

  When the celestial mount shall totter, burning
    In all-devouring flame,
  When seas go dry, where crocodiles are turning
    And sharks no man may tame,
  When the compact earth itself shall tumble sheer,
    Great mountains madly dance,
  What of our bodies, quivering like the ear
    Of baby elephants?
}

{
  LOGIC

  How long may subtle logic play its part
  In science and theology and art?
    So long as no young fawn-eyed maiden's glance
  Shall find its way to the logician's heart.

  THE ANGER OF THE KING

  None from the anger of the king
    May be released;
  The fire consumes the offering
    And burns the priest.

}

{
  THE RAINS

  And when the rainy days are come,
  Your lady-love must stay at home;
  She clings to you, a little bold
  Because she shivers with the cold;
  The breeze is fresh with heaven's spray
  And drives her lassitude away:
  When happy lovers are together,
  The rainy time is fairest weather.
}

{
  THE LOVERS' ALLY

  Ye maids, exhaust your haughty scorn
    On lovers bending low;
  For soon the breeze in southland born,
  With sandal sweet, will blow.
}

{
  WHY?

  The deer, the fish, the good man hunger
    For grass, for water, for content;
  Yet hunter, fisher, scandalmonger
    Pursue each harmless innocent.

  So bad men causeless interfere
    To persecute the good.
}

{
  ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE

  Child for an hour, and lovesick youth an hour,
    Beggar an hour, then fanned by riches' breath,
  The wrinkled actor, Man, bereft of power,
    Creeps tottering behind the curtain, Death.
}

{
  THE WAY OF THE WORLD

  In daily journeys of the sun
  Our little life is quickly done;
  In anxious duties of the day
  The hours unnoticed slip away;
  Though birth and age are ever near,
  And grief and death, we do not fear:
  The world forgets its sore distress,
  Goes mad with wine of heedlessness.
}

{
  SHE ONLY LOOKED

  She did not redden nor deny
    My entrance to her room;
  She did not speak an angry word;
    She did not fret and fume;
  She did not frown upon poor me,
    Her lover now as then;
  She only looked at me the way
    She looks at other men.

{
  WHO UNDERSTANDS A MAN?

  Once he would follow at my feet,
    Obey my slightest word;
  And black was black, if black to me,
    Or white, if I preferred;
  And he began to walk or sit
    The moment I began;
  But he is different now. Oh, dear!
    Who understands a man?

{
  UNTRUSTWORTHY THINGS

  The things that can claw, and the things that can gore,

    And rivers and women and kings.

{
  TWO VIEWS OF LIFE
  When ignorance my life entwined,
  Love's ointment made me strangely blind-
  I thought the world was made of womankind.

  But clearer judgment than, of yore
  The veil before my vision tore-
  I knew that God is all the world and more.

  SHOULD FANCY CEASE

  The lover's patient fancy brings him peace,

    And hearts that shrivel in the burning chaff must die.

  WHAT THEN?-I

  What if my life is fed
    With all that seems most sweet?
  What if my foeman's head

  What if my soul ascends
    Through countless lives? What then?

{
  WHAT THEN?-II

  Old rags, or fine, white silk that flows and clings-
    Why should I care?
  Poor wife, or horses, elephants, and things-
    What difference there?

    Why care again?
  God's light, or groping in the dark once more-
    What then? What then?

  JOYOUS TREASURES

  How hard a thing it is that they achieve
    Whose hearts the thought of God keeps pure and bright,
  Who for His sake earth's joyous treasures leave
    Without a pang at losing such delight!

  Those joyous treasures I could never get;
    I cannot get them now; I am not sure
  That I shall ever win to them; and yet
    I cannot flout the thought, the hope, the lure.
}

{
  VEXATIONS-I

  The scholarship that grasps at straws,
    The woman's love that must be bought,
  The life that hangs on tyrants' laws-
    These things are with vexation fraught.
}
{
  [Hitopadesha]
}

{
  VEXATIONS-II

  The fear of dying vexes birth;
    Age vexes flashing youth ;
  The carper vexes honest worth;
    Irresolution, truth.

  To vex our peace the women love;
    Our joy, ambition's sting;
  Rogues vex the court, and snakes the grove;
    And something, everything.
}

{
  LOVE, THE FISHER

  Love, the fisher, casts his woman-hook
    Into the sea of lust and fond desire,
  And just as soon as greedy men-fish look
    And snap the red bait, lips so sweet, so dire,
  Then he is quick to catch them and to cook
    The hungry wretches over passion's fire.
}

{
  EPHEMERAL POTIONS

  If mouths are dry with thirst,
  Men think of water first;
  If hungry, bolt their rice
  With many a toothsome spice;
  If love flames bright and brighter,
  They clasp the women tighter:
  They have the strangest notions;
  They think ephemeral potions
  Will heal the soul's commotions.
}

{
  ALL THESE THINGS SHALL BE ADDED

  What though she have a bosom sweet,
    A form to beauty wed,
  A face in which the graces meet-
    She must not turn your head.

  Nay, if her charm your fancy haunts,
    Then live on virtue's food;
  One cannot have the things he wants
    Except by being good.
}

{
  THE BLIND FOREST

  The lady's body is a forest blind,
    With dangerous hills, her bosom fair;
  Think not to wander there, my mind;
    The robber, Love, is lurking there.

  THE LITTLENESS OF THE WORLD

  Why should the truly wise man wish
    To hold the world in fee?
  'Tis but the leaping of a baby fish

  FRIENDSHIP'S END

  Yes, you were I, and I was you,
  So fond the love that linked us two;
  Alas, my friend, for friendship's end!

{
  A WASTED LIFE-I

  No stainless wisdom have I learned;
  No honest money have I earned;
  No fond obedience have I brought
  To parents, with a heart well-taught;
  I never dreamed of sweet embraces,
  Of sparkling eyes and roguish faces:
  My life was wasted like the crow's:
  I lived on strangers' bread and blows.
}

{
  A WASTED LIFE-II

  I never learned to vanquish other men
    In conference, with the just and fitting word;
  I never made high heaven ring again,
    Praising the elephant-hunter's sturdy sword;
  I never tasted honey from the kind,
    Soft lips of maids when moonlight scatters gloom:
  My youth is gone and left no good behind,
    A candle burning in an empty room.
}

{
  A WASTED LIFE-III
  The paths of thought I never trod
  Which lead to unity in God;
  Nor were my days to virtue given
  Which opens wide the gates of heaven;
  Delights of love that men esteem
  Were mine not even in a dream:
  I was a sorry axe in sooth
  To cut the tree, my mother's youth.
}

{
  FLAMING BANNERS

  Learning and dignity,
    Wisdom and manners
  Last till the god of love
    Plants flaming banners.

{
  THE THIEF OF HEARTS

  You practice theft by strangest arts
    Once and again;
  In broad daylight you steal the hearts
    Of waking men.

{
  TWO KINDS OF FRIENDSHIP

  The friendship of the rogue or saint,
    Like shade at dawn or shade at noon,
  Starts large and slowly grows more faint,
    Or starting faint, grows larger soon.
}
{
  ārambha-gurvī kṣayiṇī krameṇa
  laghvī purā vṛddhimatī ca paścāt |
  dinasya pūrvārdha-parārdha-bhinnā
  chāyeva maitrī khala-saj-janānām || BharSt_1.60 ||
}
{
Tawney:
  The kindness of the bad at first
    Is great, and then doth wane;
  The good man's love, at th' outset small,
    Slowly doth bulk attain;
  Such difference between these two
    In nature doth abide,
  As 'twixt the shadow of the morn
    And that of eventide.

More:
  Like as the shadows of the twilight hour
    Differ from those at morn,
  So doth a good man's friendship in its power
    From that of evil born : —
  One small at first still stronger, deeper grows,
    One shortens to the close.
}

{
  CHOOSING A VOCATION

  What shall I do in these few hours of life?
  Live humbly with a sweet, religious wife?
  Renounce the world, the ties of kindred sever,
  And spend my days beside the sacred river?
  Drink deep of honeyed poems' nectar-flow?
  Or learn philosophy? I hardly know.
}

{
  THE GOOD ARE RARE

  Through thoughts and words and deeds their virtues flow
    To all the world their kindness brings delight;
  They make a mote of good in others show
    Like a great mountain; for their hearts are bright,
  And brighten all they touch with their own worth:
  How many such are to be found on earth?
}

{
  THERE WAS A NOBLE CITY

  There was a noble city old,
  A mighty king, and vassals bold;
  And there were gathered scholars true,
  And moon-faced ladies not a few;
  And there were princes proud and free,
  And stories told, and minstrelsy:
  A memory now; we mourn their fall
  And honor Time, who levels all.
}

{
  WHERE EDUCATION FAILS

  Though many youths a training get
  In law, religion, etiquette,
  Why are there few whose actions would,
  Interpreted, seem wholly good?

  Some arching brow is sure to be
  As cunning as a master-key,
  That serves its purpose passing well
  In flinging wide the gates of hell.
}

{
  ON GIVING A DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE

  A girl is held in trust, another's treasure;
    To arms of love my child today is given;
  And now I feel a calm and sacred pleasure;
    I have restored the pledge that came from heaven.
}
{
  [Shakuntala]
}

{
  STRUGGLING FANCIES

  It is my body leaves my love, not I;
    My body moves away, but not my mind;
  For back to her my struggling fancies fly
    Like silken banners borne against the wind.
}
{
  [Shakuntala]
}

{
  OH, MIGHT I END THE QUEST!

  I dug beueath the earth most greedily
    In search of hidden treasure;
  I smelted ore; I crossed the mighty sea,
    Forgetting every pleasure;
  I cringed to kings; and muddling all my brains
    With magic, lost my rest:
  But never got a penny for my pains;
    Oh, might I end the quest!

Miller:
  I mined the earth in search of treasure,

  Crossed treacherous oceans' expanses,
  Placated kings with devoted care;
  Bent on evoking the powers occult,
  By night I roamed the burning grounds.
  Yet ne'er a broken cowry shell did I obtain-
  Cursed greed, grant me at least some reprieve!
}

{
  WHAT DELIGHTS AND HURTS

  It is the truth sans prejudice I speak;
    Ye people, heed this truth forever true;
  All that delights in women you must seek,
    And all that hurts, you find in women too.

{
Miller:
  I do indeed speak without bias,
  This is acknowledged as truth among men:
  Nothing enthralls us like an ample-hipped woman,
  Nothing else causes such pain.
}

{
  THE SWEETEST THINGS
  The sweetest sight a man may see
    Is a maiden's loving face;
  The sweetest thing to touch should be
    Her body's close embrace;

  Her voice should be the sweetest sound;
    Her breath, the sweetest scent;
  The sweetest taste, the honey found
    On lips to kisses lent;

  The thought of her is fervent prayer,
    Religion's sweetest part;
  The charm of her is everywhere
    Unto the pure in heart.
}


{
  THE UNLUCKY MAN

  A bald man once, whose hairless pate
  Felt inconveniently hot,
  Fled to a cocoa-tree at noon-
  He hoped to find a shady spot.
  And then a big nut fell, and crack!
  The poor, hald head was split in two.
  Misfortunes almost always find
  The man whom evil fares pursue.

{
Tawney:
  A bald man felt the sun's fierce rays
    Scorch his defenceless head,
  In haste to shun the noontide blaze
    Beneath a palm he fled:
  Prone as he lay, a heavy fruit
    Crashed through his drowsy brain:
  Whom fate has sworn to persecute
    Finds every refuge vain.

More:
    An old man bald as a copper pot,
    Because one noon his head grew hot,
    Crawled to a spreading bilva-tree
    To seek the shade. By Fate's decree
    A fruit just then came tumbling down,
    And cracked the old man's brittle crown
    With loud explosion — which was worse. —
  Ill dogs us everywhere when Fate's averse.
}

{
  A REASON FOR RENUNCIATION

  Possessions leave us at the end,
    However long they stay;
  Then why not cast aside, my friend,
    What leaves us anyway?

  And if they leave against our will,
    The heart takes time in mending;
  If given willingly, they fill
    That heart with joy unending.
}

{
  RENUNCIATION

  What does renunciation mean?
  It means a lonely woodland scene
  Remote from men and human sin,
  From woes of love, from love of kin,
  Free from the world, a life apart
  That slays the tortures of the heart
  As fear of death and fear of birth:
  It means the best of heaven and earth.
}

{
  THE BETTER PART

  Is there no splendid Himalayan height
    Cooled by the spray from Ganges' holy springs,
  With rocks where fairies now and then alight,
    That men should fawn upon contemptuous kings?
}

{
  THE FIVE ROBBERS

  "Here are banquets, and singing sweet,
  Perfumes, and glimpse of dancing feet,
  And bosoms that on mine may bear."

  Five rascal senses whisper this,
  Lead me from virtue much amiss,
  And cheat me of my highest bliss.
}

{
  WHEN WOMAN WILLS

  When loving woman wants her way.
  God hesitates to say her nay.
}

{
A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE

  A fool's opinion easily is bent;
    More easy 'tis to win the wise and great;
  But God himself could never make content
    The man who feels himself elate
    With one small grain of knowledge in his pate.

{
Tawney:
  Easy is a fool to manage, easier still a man of sense,
  Brahma's self is foiled by one of little brains and great pretence.
More:
  Lightly an ignorant boor is made content,
  And lightlier yet a sage;
  But minds by half-way knowledge warped and bent,
  Not Brahma's self their fury may assuage.
}

{
  THE WEAKER SEX

  The classic poets make a great mistake;
    Forever of the weaker sex they speak;
  When gods are subjugated for the sake
    Of starry glances, are the women weak?

  YOUNG WOMANHOOD

  Half-smiles that brighten on her face,
    Innocent, roving glances,
  The wealth of budding charms that show
    In little steps and dances,

  The flow of words that shyly prove
    The sweet, new woman-feeling:
  Yes, all the fawn-eyed maiden does
    Is wondrously appealing.
}

{
  THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE

  A few brave men pursue
    Rogue elephants to death;
  There are a braver few
    Who stop the lion's breath;
  The bravest of the brave-
    And fewer yet they prove-
  Are they who can enslave
    The haughty god of love.
}

{
  DIGNITY

  The dog will roll, and wag his tail, and fawn,
  Show mouth and belly, just to get some meat;
  The majestic elephant gazes gravely on;
  Till coaxed a hundred times, he will not eat.

  Dogs fawn on those who bring them meat,
  And grovel whimpering at their feet
  With upturned throat, and wag their tails in gamesome mood;

  Bates not one jot of self-respect,
  And after thousand coaxings deigns to taste his food.

{
  IN THE DAYS OF THY YOUTH

  While life is vigorous and bright,
    While sickness comes not, nor decay,
  While all your powers are at their height,
    While yet old age is far away,
  Then, wise man, let your thoughts be turning
    To heaven's hopes and fears of hell;
  For when the house is fired and burning,
    It is too late to dig a well.

  THEY WANT THE EARTH

  'Tis but a little ball of mud

    So poor are they, so mean;
  And men will fawn on such a king!
    Oh, shame upon the scene!

{
  THE BEASTS THAT DON'T EAT GRASS

  Unschooled in music, poetry, and art,
    Man is a beast, a hornless, tailless beast;
   He doesn't eat the grass; for this at least
  The other beasts may well be glad at heart.

  A beast without the tail and horns;

  WHY MEN BEG

  Is there a man of spirit who would beg
    In broken words that stumble with his sobbing,
  Harsh sobs of him who fears a surly "No!"
    And all to ease his belly's empty throbbing?

  None but the man who sees his wretched wife
    Sad always, sees her worn and ragged skins,
  Sees sad-faced babies tugging at their folds
    With screams that tell how fiercely hunger hurts.

  If other men did not see his wife the pitiful victim
  Of poverty's woe, and the gaunt faces
  Of his starved and whimpering children
  As they pulled at their mother's ragged clothes,
  How could he stammer out the word "give"
  That sticks in his throat from fear of rebuff?
  What high-minded man would stoop to beg
  For the sake of his own empty belly?

  THE WISE MISOGYNIST

  The wise misogynist, poor soul,
  To self-deceit is given;

  NECTAR AND POISON

  All nectar and all poison lives

  For she is nectar when she loves,
    And poison when she hates.

  There is no ambrosia or poison
  Except in the love of an ample-hipped woman;
  Enamored, she is an ambrosial vine,
  Indifferent, a poisonous creeper.
}

{
  THE ONE THING NEEDFUL

  Why should I study scripture, sacred lore,
  0r any good, big book? Why get a store
  Of pious actions, anxiously performed—
  And win a humble tent in heaven, no more?

  The knowledge of myself is all I need
  To give me lasting joy, to burn the seed
    Of the interminable pain of life—
  Let pious peddlers show their wares and plead.
}

{
  THE TWO THINGS THAT MATTER

  Why all this talk and foolish chatter?
  There are just two things that really matter:
  A buxom, young, and frisky wife;
  Or else a lonely forest-life.

  Why all these words and empty prattle?
  Two worlds alone are worth a man's devotion.
  The youth of beautiful women wearied by heavy breasts
  And full of fresh wine's heady ardor for sport,
  Or the forest ...
}

{
  UNINTELLIGIBLE VIRTUE
  Are palace-joys so incomplete?
    Is song a despicable pleasure?
  And is there anything so sweet
    As clasping her you love and treasure?

  Yet pious men account these things
  As vain as flickering candlelight
  'Neath dancing moths on troubled wings;
  And to the woods they take their flight.
}

{
  THE LINES OF FATE
  If thorn-plants in the desert leafless be,
    The spring is not to blame.
  If owls in broadest daylight cannot see,
    The sun should feel no shame.
  If in the plover's bill no raindrops fall,
    'Twere wrong to blame the cloud.
  The lines that fate has written once for all,
    Are never disallowed.
}

{
  POVERTY

  The moon by night, the sun by day
  Continue in their heavenly way;
  One rag they have, one ragged cloud
  To serve them both as robe and shroud.
  Poor things!
}

{
  HOW HARD FATE GRIPS

  The snake and elephant are caged;
  The moon and sun must meet eclipse;
  The prudent are in strife engaged
  With poverty. How hard fate grips!

  WHEN MY LOVE DRAWS NIGH

  When my love draws nigh,
    When his voice I hear,
  Why am I all eye?
    Why am I all ear?

{
  THE HERMIT

  I seem to see a hermit good:
  He has no pride, he begs his food;
  From man-made laws his acts are free;
  He seeks no man's society;
  He has no care for common ways
  Of giving, getting all his days;
  He stitches up his garment ragged
  With wayside tatters, torn and jagged;
  No false conceit his fancy haunts—
  Eternal peace is all he wants.
}

{
  WHY GO TO COURT?

  I am not fashion's changing sport,
  I never acted, sang, nor hated;
  What figure should I cut at court?
  I am no lady languid-gaited.
}

{
  IMPOSSIBLE!

  The consecrated saints of old
    Who lived on water, leaves, and air,
  Went mad with love when they beheld
    A face that showed how maids are fair.

  And if the common men who eat
    Their rice and milk and curds and ghee,
  Should curb the wish for things so sweet,
    The mountains would fly oversea.
}

{
  HINDRANCES
  'Twould not be hard, through life's gray sea
    To find the track;
  But fawn-eyed women hinder me,
    And hold me hack.
}

{
  DIVINE VISION

  My love is in a distant land,
  And yet I see her where I stand.
  The gods have vision less divine,
  Because the eye of love is mine.

  WHY MY POEMS DIED

  The patrons full of pride,
  The public had no judgment;

{
  A CONSOLATION

  If there are famous poets, fit
    To teach the art of poesy,
  So sweetly smooth their verses flit,

}
{
  Worn with hunger, faint and feeble, shorn of glory and of power,
  Still the king of beasts is kingly, even to his dying hour;
  Will he graze on hay like oxen ? No, he longs to meet once more
  Tusk-armed elephants in battle, and to drink their spouting gore.

{
  Fling a dry and gristly cow's-bone to a low-bred cur to gnaw,
  Straight he wags his tail delighted, though it cannot fill his maw.
  Lions spare the prostrate jackal, but the forest monarchs smite,
  E'en by fortune pressed the valiant scorns to waive his proper right.

  All men alike, birth after birth,
  Enter upon a life on earth;

{
  Down to the lowest pit with rank, and gifts that all admire;
  Hurl virtue headlong from the steep, burn pedigrees with fire;
  On valour let the bolt descend: for wealth alone we pray,
  Without which noble qualities are vile as mouldy hay.

  All qualities with gold are sent,
    And vanish when it flies.

  The king by evil counsel falls,
    By worldliness the saint,
  Brahmans by want of sacred lore,
    Bad friends good manners taint;
  Indulgence spoils a son, and he
    Upon his race brings shame,
  Continual absence poisons love,
    Neglect cools friendship's flame;
  Carelessness ruins husbandry,
    Wrong saps a nation's health,
  Wine chases modesty, unthrift
    And largess squander wealth.

  Less in size the polished jewel, but its rays far brighter gleam,
  Who regrets the dwindling sandbanks when boon autumn swells the stream?
  Glorious we hold the victor, though his life-blood gild the plain,

Lo! the same man who longs for a handful of meal
  As a treasure of infinite worth,
When his hunger is sated, esteems not a straw
  All the riches and glories of earth ;
Hence this moral we draw—in this transient world
  Nothing 's trifling or great in itself,
'Tis the mind that projects its own hues on the mass,
  Now 'tis gold, now 'tis counted but pelf.

  Charity best adorns the hand
    And reverence the head,
  Truth is the virtue of the mouth
    In th' ears is scripture read,
  Valour lends glory to the arms,
    Contentment calms the heart,
  Thus lofty souls, though poor, are decked
    With grace in every part.

  In times of joy the hero's soul
    Is soft as lotus-flower,
  But when misfortune's billows roll
    Stands stiff as granite tower.
}
{
}
{
  A noble soul, in days of power,
  Is tender as a lotus-flower:
  But when it meets misfortune's shock,
  Grows hard as Himalayan rock.

  Raindrops on heated iron flung dissolve in airy steam,
  The same on lotus-leaflets hung like rows of diamonds gleam,
  In sea-shells, if Arcturus shine, they harden into pearl,—
  E'en so doth intercourse refine and elevate the churl.

  He only can be called a son who gratifies his sire,

  He only is a friend who bides the same in weal and woe,—
  These blessings three the righteous gods on virtuous men bestow.

  Who still to selfish ends prefer
    The good of other men.

  Trees are bowed down with weight of fruit,
    Clouds big with rain hang low,
  So good men humbly bear success,
    Nor overweening grow.

{
  No earrings deck the good man's ears, which still on scripture feed;
  His hands, still open to the poor, no golden bracelets need;
  The perfume of his kindly acts, like flowers in leaves concealed,
  Exceeds the fragrant scent which nard and sandal unguents yield.

{
  Some generous souls forbear their own, and seek another's gain;
  Most men, neglecting not their own, their neighbour's cause maintain;
  Those are mere demons who would build their wealth on other's loss,
  But what are those who profitless their neighbour's interest cross?

  Milk to the water with it mixed its native virtues gave,

  True friendship envy cannot reach, nor fiery pains abate!

# The Praise of firmness

{

  sudhāṃ vinā na parayur virāmaṃ
  na niścitārthād viramanti dhīrāḥ || BharSt_1.81 ||

  The gods with priceless jewels were not bought,
  Nor with the poison-chalice made aghast,
  Nor ceased until they held the nectar fast,
  The firm forsake not what they once have sought.

}
{
  Sleeping sometimes upon the ground, sometimes on gorgeous bed,
  Sometimes with simple herbs content, sometimes on dainties fed,
  One moment clothed in rags, anon ruffling in gallant show,
  The hero, following still his end, recks not of joy or woe.
}

{
  Mercy's the ornament of power, of courage courteous rede,
  Of learning modesty, of wealth bounty to those that need,
  Of hermits gentleness and truth, longsuffering of a king,
  Of all men virtuous character, whence all these glories spring.

    Firm souls from virtue will not stray.

  A snake lay helpless in the box pining for lack of meat,
  A rat by night gnaws through the side, and yields his foe a treat,
  With strength recruited then the snake by that same hole escapes,—
  Behold how vain our efforts are! Fate all our fortune shapes.
}
{
    A captive snake half dead with fright
    Starved in a basket; till one night
    A silly mouse, who roamed abroad,
    A hole straight through the wicker gnawed,
    And in his very gullet jumped.
    The serpent felt his thin sides plumped,
    Took cheer, and wriggled out in turn. —
  Who knows all lucky falls in Fortune's urn?

{
}
{
  Flung down with force, the higher springs the ball,
  So good men rise victorious from their fall.
  Sloth is the foe that makes our souls his lair,
  Vigour the friend that saves us from despair.

  The moon her wasted orb renews,
    The tree when pruned puts forth fresh leaf,
  Th' afflicted sage this course pursues,
    Nor yields to unavailing grief.

# The Praise of Destiny

{

}
{
  Under Vrihaspati's own eyes
    Entrenched on heaven's height
  Wielding th' artillery of the skies,
    Followed by gods in fight,
  Indra, in spite of all his skill,
    Has seen his host give way ;
  Strength nought avails.—To whom she will
    Fortune assigns the day.

  Our fates, our minds, depend on deeds
  Done in the soul's career,
  But each can gain the wit he needs
  By careful conduct here.

  When sun and moon eclipsed I see,

  And wise men vexed with poverty;
    I own, my soul desponds.

}
{
  No wonder sages figure Fortune blind;
  She first creates a hero to her mind,
  Whom all men own the glory of the age,
  Then breaks her model in her childish rage.
}
{
}
{
}

{

}
{
  If thorns and briars bear no leaves we do not blame the Spring,
  Nor yet the sun, if blinking owls fly not till evening.
  That _châtaks_ gape in vain for showers is not the cloud's disgrace;
  Fate's sentence written on the brow no hand can e'er efface.

# The Praise of Works

{

  phalaṃ karmāyattaṃ yadi kim amaraiḥ kiṃ ca vidhinā

}
{
  Why honour gods, who must submit to Fate,
    Or Fate, who gives but what our deeds have won ?
  Upon our deeds alone depends our state
    By these exalted, as by these undone.
}
{
}
{
}

}
{
  Mighty are works, which Brahmâ's self confined within the egg,
  Which forced e'en Siva, skull in hand, from house to house to beg,
  Made Vishnu through ten tedious births his deity disguise,
  Which daily bind th' unwilling sun to wander through the skies!

    On ocean waves, and mountain snows.

{
  Kindness can turn the bad man's heart, and fools convert to wise,
  Make poison into nectar-juice, and friends of enemies,
  Bring distant objects near: then strive that talisman to gain,
  Nor set thy heart on glorious gifts acquired with endless pain.

  What is the use of living with the wise ?
  As well be friends with those that truth despise.
  Who loses time suffers no loss at all,
  Who justly deals shall find his profit small,

  A virtuous wife's no blessing one should choose,

  A woman's heart is like a glass, reflecting every face,
  Her secret thoughts, like mountain paths, are difficult to trace,
  Her fancy wavers, like the dew which lotus-leaves enclose,
  Her faults, like deadly Upas-buds, develop as she grows.

{
  Who falls in sight of either host
    Upon th' ensanguined plain,
  Though victory and heaven be lost,
    From both sides praise doth gain.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  The Boar's and Râhu's  mighty deeds our reverence command;
  The one upheld with gleaming tusks the sea-o'erwhelmed land;
  The other, sorely maimed in fight, while head and throat remain,
  Makes shift to swallow still the foes he must release again.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
The land is limited by sea, the sea its bounds must keep,
The ever-wandering orb of day measures heaven's trackless deep;
All things are fettered and restrained, except the sage's mind,
Which springs beyond the bourn of death, and ranges unconfined.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  Between Vishnu and Siva there's nothing to choose,
  Be thy home but a cave, it will serve thee as well,
  Man in woods and in deserts the same course pursues,
  And a friend's but a friend in a court or a cell.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  By tortoise, hills, and king of snakes
  Upheld and poised, earth's centre shakes;
  Men of firm faith and constant soul
  Swerve not, while endless ages roll.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  Does not the tortoise feel the load he bears without complaint?
  Is not the flaming lord of day with ceaseless wandering faint?
  Are not good men though sore distressed ashamed their troth to break?
  Great spirits love to carry through whate'er they undertake.
}
{
}

}

{
}
{
  Cymbals to harmonize their tone,
  Must first with flour be fed;
  So he can call all bards his own
  Who fills their mouths with bread.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  The mean pursue a thousand ways to satisfy their greed,
  But he will ne'er be chief of saints whose gain's his highest meed,
  The Aurva-fire drinks up the sea to still its craving maw,
  The cloud, to cheer a thirsty world, the waves doth upward draw.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  Hard fate to minister and bard assigned,
  One must new turns and one new taxes find;
  By honeyed language both aspire to climb,
  This slowly builds his power, and that his rhyme;
  A captious public both must toil to please,
  And part unthanked with liberty and ease.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
Though fortune shower her blessings everywhere,
  But few will reach the poor man's lowly head;
  Though rain-clouds all day long their treasures shed,
Three drops at most reward the _châtak's_ prayer.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  A man should reverence the sage,
    Not only when he gives advice,—
  The random words of prudent age,
    If rightly weighed, are pearls of price.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  The good man, like a bounding ball,
  Springs ever upward from his fall;
  The wicked falls like lump of clay,
  And crumbles into dust away.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  What though by some untoward fate no lotus on the lake be born,
  The swan will ne'er, like barndoor fowl, rake in the dust for grains of corn.
}
{
}
{
NOBILITY

If fate should ever stay the birth
  Of every lily on the earth,
Do you suppose that swans would scratch.
  Like roosters, in the dunghill patch?
}

{
}
{
  The heart of the contented man enjoys perpetual peace,
  The covetous pine with lust of wealth; their cravings never cease;
  Not Meru's peak, of gold entire, can captivate my soul,
  Let him, who likes it, clamber up and carry off the whole.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  From nature comes the lotus' rosy hue,
  By nature good men others' good pursue,
  And cruel men have cruel ends in view.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  Truth is the ornament of all mankind,
  Slim elephants delight the keeper's mind,
  Learning and patience are a Brahman's boast,
  Each creature's highest good becomes it most.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  Better to fall from mountain height,
    And dash thy life out on the plain,
  Better th' envenomed serpent's bite,
    Better the death in fiery pain,
  Than once to swerve from virtue's path,
    Which they who lose ne'er find again.
}
{
    Better from the sheer mountain-top
    Headlong thy ruined body drop;
    Better appease the serpent's ire
    With thy right hand; or in the fire
    Behold thy riven members tost,
  Than once thy mind's integrity were lost.
}
{
}

{
}
{
  Abandon, fool, thy hope to see
  The brave man dread calamity;
  When the great doom shall earth o'ertake
  Nor seas, nor mighty hills will quake.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  The moon the lord of healing herbs,
    Whose gleaming horn is Siva's crest,
  Is doomed with dim eclipse to pine ;
    None can avoid grim Fate's behest.
}
{
}
{
}

{
}
{
  A splendid palace, lovely brides, the symbols all of kingly sway,
  Are jewels strung on merit's thread stretching through many a toilsome day;
  As pearls are from a necklace shed, when breaks the bond that held them fast,
  Light they disperse, when merit fails, whirled from us by misfortune's blast.
}

{

{
A friend or stranger comes he? — so
  They reckon of the narrow mind;
But some of broader reason know
  In all the world one kith and kind.
}
{
}

{
}
{
}
{
    I saw an ass who bore a load
    Of sandal wood along the road,
    And almost with the burden bent,
    Yet never guessed the sandal scent;
    So pedants bear a ponderous mass
  Of books they comprehend not, — like the ass
}
{
}

{
}
{
}
{
    Wisdom acquire and knowledge hive,
    As thou a thousand years mightst thrive;
    For virtue toil with sleepless care,
  As Death already grasped thee by the hair.
}
{
}

{
}
{
}
{
Say thou what kindly is and truth,
Say not the true that wakens ruth,
Say not the kind that is not sooth.

Yet rather silence were preferred,
And second truth, and the law third,
And only fourth the kindly word.
}
{
}

{
}
{
}
{
    One law there is: no deed perform
    To others that to thee were harm;
    And this is all, all laws beside
  With circumstances alter or abide.
}
{
}

{
}
{
}
{
    This have I done, and that will do,
    And this half-done must carry through: —
    So busied, bustling, full of care,
  Poor fools, Death pounces on us unaware.

    To-day is thine, fulfill its work,
    Let no loose hour her duty shirk;
    Still ere thy task is done, comes Death,
  The Finisher, — he ends it with thy breath.

  THE PERVERSITY OF FATE

  I see a dog, but not a stone;
  I find a stone, the dog is flown;
  If dog and stone at once I view,
  The king's dog! Damn! What can I do?
         —From the _Anthology_

  SIMPLE JUSTICE
If, maiden of the lotus eye,
  Your anger hurts you so,
'Tis right you should not let it die,
  You hardly could, you know.

But once I gave you an embrace,
  To keep it would be pain;
And once I kissed your willing face,
  Give me that kiss again.
                    — From Amaru
}

FORESIGHT
From loving girls, ye wise, refrain;
'Tis little pleasure, longer pain.
But love three females none the less,
Compassion, Wisdom, Friendliness.
For swelling breasts of lovely girls,
Trembling beneath their strings of pearls,
And hips with jingling girdles—well,
They do not help you much in hell.
}

}
{
}
{
}
{
ALL OR NOTHING
Vishnu or Shiva—but one god I crave;
    One friend—a lordly king or hermit good;
    One home—a city or a lonely wood;
One love—a beauty or a desert cave.
}

{
}
{
}
{
}
{
THE FLATTERER
By stammering and tumbling down
You try to smooth the monarch's frown;
In the farce of life you play the clown.

What part, I wonder, will you play,
When age has sucked your strength away,
And when your ears are fringed with gray?
}

{
}
{
}
{
}
{
Hark to the counsel of the good,
  Although irrelevant it looks;
Their simple talk is richer food
  And wiser than the best of books.

Wandered a weary, weary maid;

Lifting the garment from her breast.

EVERYTHING OR NOTHING

Suppose you have the sweetest song before you,
  The graceful poets of the south beside you,
Fan-girls behind who winsomely adore you
  With tinkling rings; if nothing be denied you,

Then you may well be most extremely greedy
  To taste each charming, mortal delectation;
But if you be in anything left needy,
  Renounce it all and plunge in meditation.
