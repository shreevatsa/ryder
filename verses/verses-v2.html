  WOMEN'S EYES

  The world is full of women's eyes,
  Defiant, filled with shy surprise,
  Demure, a little overfree,
  Or simply sparkling roguishly;
  It seems a gorgeous lily-bed,
  Whichever way I turn my head.

  The moonbeams that by day depart;
  The maid whose youthful beauty flies;

Miller:
  The moon paled by day,
  An amorous lady with lost youth,
  A lake without lotuses,
  The dumb face of a handsome man,
  A prince obsessed with wealth,
  A man of virtue ever wretched,
  A villain come to the court of a king—

  For if thou dwell within the desert's bound,
